- All listings **must** be posted from reputable platforms like Grailed, Ebay, Depop, Poshmark, etc. 

- All transactions are to be conducted through these sites. If you go offsite, you do so at your own risk.

- **All disputes should be handled through Grailed/Ebay/Paypal.**
__________________________________

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers. 

- Ask for measurements if there aren't any. Tag sizes vary wildly. 

If you want to do a trade: 

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection.",Buy Sell Thread - January 27

74,malefashionadvice,"I have in the past bought mostly budget mall-friendly clothes from the likes of Uniqlo, H&amp;M, Mango, Polo Ralph Lauren, Fred Perry, etc. Recently I decided to up my game a little and ventured to Mr. Porter. One of the items I bought was the Mr. P polo below, made from a lightweight knit. I liked the collar. The instructions said to hand wash or dry clean.

I got it a few days ago and wore it, fit pretty well. Then I handwashed it in lukewarm water, and line dried it in the sun. It visibly shrunk significantly. I estimate 6%-8%. The fit is obviously different now and is quite tight. The only saving grace is that it being a stretchy knitwear, I can stretch it out a bit to make things look better. 

My questions are:
1. Is there anyway to prevent shrinkage in clothes?
2. Is there anything I can do to my polo above?

They weren’t massively cheaper than they are in the shop (£65) and look at fit as well as my other 510s. I did get a bit worried as some reviews suggest they might be fakes so I looked into it in more detail. 

According to the ‘how to spot a fake’ websites, they tick all of the boxes confirming they’re real (lot number on inside of waist button, stamp of authenticity, clean stitching, LS &amp; CO CF stamping on rivets etc.) BUT the red tab on the rear pocket states ‘LEVI’S’ not ‘Levi’s’ as many sites claim is a sign of a fake. 

However, and this is where it gets interesting, I decided to look at my 511s which were bought from the Levi’s shop in Leeds and they too have an uppercase E. Another pair of 510s have just the registered trademark and one has the lower case e.

I had to exchange my belts for a different size and that's when this nightmare began.

Day 7 - Tracking says belts have arrived at Meermin NY.

Day 11 - I contacted Meermin to make sure they received the belts.

Day 15 - No response from Meermin, so I contacted them AGAIN to see if they received the belts.

Day 17 - Meermin confirmed receipt. They will ship the replacement ""this week"" and reply with tracking when available.

Day 28 - No response from Meermin, so I contacted them to see if the replacements have been shipped.

Day 31 - Meermin responded saying the belts I wanted are now sold out so they asked me to pick different ones. I did, and they said they will reply with tracking once available.

Day 40 - No response from Meermin, so I contacted them AGAIN to see WTF is going on.

I still don't have my replacements and I wonder if I'll ever get them.

It's lightweight to mediumweight fabric cut into similar to a long-sleeved button-down shirt, but the buttons are only from the collar to mid-chest. The shirt is meant to be worn un-tucked.

My problem is that the offices in which I work are very cold (due to AC). So I'd like to wear a jacket or blazer on top of it not only for warmth, but generally to make me look more dapper (I'm a chunky dude, so a well-tailored jacket would be great).

145,malefashionadvice,"Hi guys,

I am attending a wedding of a relative in few months and for this reason I would need to buy a suit. To be frank, I have only bought one suit so far and it was off the shelf. It isn't bad but obviously the fit isn't perfect and it is a bit bigger on me at some parts. 

Thus I decided to use this wedding as the excuse to spend a bit more money on a suit for the first that is tailored to my size AND to fulfill kind of ""dream"" suit that I have kept in mind for quite some time to ""do one day when I have the opportunity."" And I have the opportunity next week when I am going shopping.

In shortly, the ""dream"" part is that I love green and I want to make a green suit work. I know that there are many other aspects to suit than the color, that are important (I have read the wiki), but this is the main point I am going to first focus on. 

To be more precise, I would probably not go for a brighter green color, **but for a darker one**, as I think it would look better and fit me better (unless there is something really nice looking and that suits me good when I went on trying stuff in the shops, but I doubt it).

**So my questions to you guys are mainly related to color combinations with the other parts of the look:**

1. What color shirt would you think would work here? When I searched online for inspo images of guys wearing green suits, I saw mainly white shirts used and some purple ones.
2. For the color combination: Should I got with Triad colors or Monochromatic look (associated colors) because I have lower-contrast complexion? ([here some photos of me from previous question where you can see my complexion](https://imgur.com/a/jVNu5lJ)). I got these ideas/suggestion from [here](https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/mans-introduction-color/) and [here](https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/men-color-contrast/) when I was reading guys on the color wheel. Complementary colors sound nice, but I do not see how I could make red work here, as it will have to be on shirt...also I should avoid complementary color combination with my complexity according the above source.
3.  What colors for tie and pocket square would you suggest? Maybe again some patterns?
4. Ideas for suit pattern that would go good with green?
5. What material for the suit? Would tweed work fine or maybe something else?
6. Shoe and belt color? I honestly don't know what shoe color would go good with green. Maybe dark brown?
7. Would something change dramatically if the waistcoat is not present in the suit? (Thus turning from 3-piece to 2-piece suit). I am asking this for just in case if there is a suit I like that somehow ends up not being 3-piece but 2-piece.

I know this is pretty vague to give any concrete plan/suggestions, but I was wondering of someone here has the experience with green suits (or just the knowledge about this even if no direct experience with the green color) and that would be able to provide some directions :) If the green suits idea doesn't workout when I do the tryouts next week, I will fallback to navy blue.

Furthermore, I am aware that trying to buy/order 3-piece suits, tie, pocket square, shoes and belt all at once is insane, especially in the short time frame I have and with my lack of experience. I will be ordering only the suit and the shirt next week. I will be thinking and planing the tie, PS and shoes more seriously after the suit and shirt are confirmed and being made and I will maybe make another post about them. I included them above just to gather some initial ideas if someone has to share :)

By the way, there is no ""color code"" for the wedding, nor is there any fear of me standing out too much or more than the bridegroom - I have already spoken with him. So there is no need to worry about such stuff.

If this would help, here is some more info on stuff that I have decided already about the suit based om the suit guide:

\- Jacket: single breasted with 2 buttons, notch lapel, two vents on jacket (might try 1 too, but probably 2),  Jetted or Flap pockets, low stance, flat shoulder seam.

\- Pants: no pleats, half/quarter break, no cuffs, 

\- Vest: classic

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;All my life I've had issues with  fabrics. I can literally only stand fabrics that are EXTREMELY soft,  like jersey t-shirt soft. I can manage with *some* sweatshirt material and *some* 100% cotton items. But overall, I detest anything that isn't super soft.  
&gt;  
&gt;When  I was young I remember wearing Levi's jeans and feeling the most  uncomfortable I've ever been. It literally feels like sandpaper. Even  trying on clothes makes me cringe. I can only ever manage with some  chinos and jeans (for work) after I shower but, for some reason, can  never put them on without showering.  
&gt;  
&gt;99.9%  of jeans are far beyond my limit. Sometimes I'll wear soft thermal  lining under my clothes for work and such, even during hot summers (live  in Cali).  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a complete  nightmare. Most people don't know about it because I still find  fashionable things to wear, but shopping is so hard and there are so  many styles that I'd like to be comfortable in. Denim is by far the most  difficult for me, but anything with any slight stiffness at all will  ruin my day.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I work at home things have gotten worse. I have been able to comfortably wear chinos from Urban Outfitters and I do have one thrifted pair of jeans that I'll wear in dire situations. I have recently gotten more into streetwear stylings - sweatpants that are cuffed at the ankles, etc. and those have worked for me.

I live in an Asian country and it's generally hot in here. I typically wear shorts / jeans / t-shirt / rubber shoes and almost never wear a jacket unless I'm inside a really cold room, or a theater.

I go to work with a very casual attire. I want to have that smart-casual-chill-guy look.

**My current wardrobe**

- Jeans / Shorts / Chinos: none of it cargo, just the regular
- T-shirt: graphic tees, company tee (not a uniform but something with company logo), plain colors
- Rubber shoes / Slippers

- rubber shoes

2. Attire 2
- Chino shorts
- t-shirt
- slippers (sometimes rubber shoes)

3. Attire 3
- Jeans
- T-shirt
- rubber shoes (sometimes slippers)

**Body Type**

I'm a short skinny guy. I hate it and I'm trying to do something about it. It's a bit difficult to find things that fit me well.

**What I need**

I'm starting to pay attention to how I project myself. I don't have the best self-esteem so I'm trying to work on myself slowly and I think dressing better would make me feel more confident.

Not looking for any drastic changes, I want to slowly integrate exciting pieces into my very limited wardrobe (as you can see above, that's all I got and I just rotate them).

Hello I bought a Levi’s denim jacket and I would like to know if it fits me well or not because I’m still in the return period. It is size Small.

Pictures: https://m.imgur.com/a/4YGpTqh

I’m only 5'5. As you can see, the sleeves are too long but is it okay if I put them like on the pictures or should I get them hemmed? Are the shoulders (the seams seem to droop) and the length fine? I read that the jacket’s length should be shorter. Do you think an XS would fit me well or too tight? My friend said something tighter would look ""gay"" on a man but that’s his opinion. I personally think it’s not disastrous but it makes me look a little boxy/baggy and I can wear slimmer things. I also paid full price for it because I liked the colour but other stores sell them for less and I don’t want to pay full price for something that fits me so-so.

[Here’s the damage. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/5HAr5U6)

I’ve seen several posts like this one but I thought I’d reach out anyway. 

I got my new pair of Iron Rangers a couple of weeks ago before traveling to visit my family. They live in the rural south. We were mostly hanging out at their house. Around the end of the first week these two deep scratches just appeared. There were some puppies running around and was in and out of cars/atvs. 

After getting back home the boots were quite dusty and dirty—at one time some one spilled Mountain Dew on them. So last night I cleaned them with the redwing foaming soap, applied leather cream (so as not to darken the leather) and the protecting spray.

I’ve seen threads where folks say just don’t worry about it and that it’s a part of the patina process but I’m wondering if anyone has tips to make them less noticeable. 

I tried dabbing mink oil INTO the scratch to try and dark them but, as you can see, the edges just got darker. 

I’m considering going ahead and either a) ignore it, wear the hell out of them or b) oil the boots to darken them all over.

Since the latter is somewhat irreversible I’m leaning more towards the former.

Anyway, any feedback would be much appreciated.",Iron Ranger 8111 - Deep Scratch

But by god, this year, I'm going to ENJOY the hot weather!

So I'm just gonna jump into this with a few question. Feel free to answer or ignore any of them, and also provide any feedback beyond my own questions.

1. Sandals vs. Flip-flops, and when are either appropriate?

2. Shoes; high-top, mid, or low/no top?

3. Shoes; colorful, or monochromatic (ie. black or white)? I'm a pale white dude, if that helps

4. Shorts; what kind of shorts look good on a bigger dude? (ie. finding that balance between being ""baggy"", and feeling like they're too tight to move around in)

5. Cargo shorts; are they *really* out of style? As long as they aren't crazy baggy, are they still out of style?

6. Pants; what would you wear for something ultra casual, like running down to the gas station or something like that?

7. Casual shirts; What looks good when just meeting some friends for drinks over the weekend, or hanging out by a bonfire?

8. Work shirts; what looks good to wear around the office, while still being cool enough (stylistically and literally) for going out on your break or after work?

9. General guidelines for the bigger guy? I've personally found that long-sleeve shirts with the sleeves rolled up look worlds better than short-sleeve shirts on me. Perhaps I should look into cooler pants, instead of shorts?","Warm/hot weather clothes and shoes for bigger guys? (31 years old, for reference)"

213,malefashionadvice,"Heya there, as the title says I'm a rather tall dude at 6' 6"" and I've always been fat so my choice in clothing has always been sweat pants and boring gray shirts. I've recently started losing weight and getting my life in order, but now I've come to realize I don't know what to wear at all or even where to begin. I don't know if anyone would actually be willing to help me, but here's just some general stuff about me to get the ball rolling.

I looked it up and I guess my body shape is more like a triangle, I have dark brown curly hair, dark brown eyes, I'm very tall at 6' 6"", my favorite color is pink, my favorite color scheme is pink and black. I am so sick of muted colors, if I never see gray again it'll be too soon. I want to finally be able to express myself.

I LOVE the idea of jackets or outerwear with short fake fur around the collar/ hood, and I THINK I'd look good in pinstripes too, but I obviously have no idea if I actually would, and big and tall clothes are expensive so I thought I'd ask people that knows more about clothes than me.",Fashion advice for a tall dude in his late 20's that's always been fat

219,malefashionadvice,"Just wanted to say thanks to Joshua and the team at FromTheFirst. On 12th December I pre ordered a pair of black leather Enzo’s which were on an 8 week delivery.... 

I have been advised by FTF today that they will be delivered to my local pick up point on Monday, meaning I’ll likely collect them on Tuesday 28th. 

In the mean time I ordered a pair of black Lucas ... they arrived within a few days and are beautifully made boots, excellent quality and very comfy. I loved these so much I asked FTF if I could add a pair of black leather Lucas to my Enzo order, and they happily obliged. 

So come Tuesday I’m getting my hands on two pairs of FTF boots, I really am very lucky 😀

I have more pairs I want to buy, I like the camel, tobacco and lion suede they do, not too sure which colour to go for next, or indeed to I get another Luca or Enzo... I’ll wait to see what the leather Enzo’s are like next week.

Yes, I wore that brand from 1996 - 2010 or so .. Perfect fit, lasted long, high quality ..  

Then, I had issues with shrinking - random shrinking issues - even took a couple packs back because it was so bad.  Seems that the batches made in Jordan or Bangladesh would shrink, the batches made in Vietnam would not shrink.  

Got tired of playing russian roulette with how well they would fit, how long till they shrunk, etc.. ( And, jc-penny was getting more and more depressing to walk into )  

So I switched to [hanes](https://www.hanes.com/shop/hanes/hanes-mens-a-shirt-117247) - didn't love the feel as much as the staffords, but learned to love them, and target would often run sales on them - so it was my new solution for years..  Starting in 2017/2018 - same random shrinking problem.. Assumed it was my partner washing them on ""hot"" and then ~~lying~~ not telling me they went through a hot load.. So I bought a couple replacement packs and now even stranger results, 2 of the pack will shrink, the rest are fine.. ~~maybe it's still random hot loads I am not told about~~ - But I would rather move to a nicer undershirt, anyway.. 

By reading many posts on reddit - I was convinced the Tesla undershirt would be perfect, but they don't do the a-shirt style. Saw many suggestions to a japanese undershirt, same issue - no a-shirt style.  

Read the beginner shirt guide and the undershirt guide - clicked on a chart - assumed Kirland would be my magical solution - then figured out that chart was a typo for Kirkland which I have seen at my local costco for years - again, not a-shirt style.

266,malefashionadvice,"Happy Thursday al! I wanted to post about my Pajar winter jacket since their website has a horrible description, they don't pay for return shipping and there are no good reviews out there! 

Their website basically offers no description on the differences between the 5-6 winter parkas that they sell. Literally I went line by line and couldn't figure out why one was more expensive than another. I ultimately went with the style that I liked the best and that had the best temperature rating. 

I went with the Samson jacket, black, size medium. It's $550.00 which is half the cost of a Canada Goose jacket. I live in Chicago and the winters here can be brutal. Especially with the WIND that I'm sure you have all heard about. I refuse to buy a Canada Goose jacket because literally everyone has one. My fiancee actually owns a Pajar jacket that she's had for years and I knew they made top quality products. They are basically the non-famous version of Canada Goose. 

So, I finally needed to buy a winter jacket after three years of living in Chicago and over the holidays they had 25%. 

I am SUPER pleased with this jacket overall. The quality is top notch. The fit is more trim than a traditional jacket although it gives me the room that I need to layer. I'm 6"" and about 180, wearing a size medium. The fur on the hood is Saga certified, which is great. The temperature rating is -30C and the down is just slightly less than what I believe I have seen on most Canada Goose jackets.

The female jacket has a fully lined fur hood and a three snap opening along the back at the bottom which would have been nice bonus features. However, there are some really nice features to this jacket including a fleece lined pocket with no closure on the bottom two pockets which is great for easily putting my hands in and out of. All the other pockets are functional and awesome as well. 

All in, it's worth the money. Let me know if you have any specific questions that I can help answer. There was so little written about this jacket I almost didn't buy it, so hopefully this will help anyone searching for insights on this company / jacket.

267,malefashionadvice,"TL;DR I like cool, unique, minimalist designs. Black and white or with lots of color. Where can I find good quality stuff like that?

---

I'm not like ""into fashion"" as in I don't know what most styles are called, I don't follow it, I don't care about brands, but I do care about what I wear and I enjoy the creativity of putting outfits together for the day. I have amassed a somewhat modular collection of cool tshirts and overshirts that I can mix and match. I usually find them at thrift stores, and outlets places like Burlington coat factory and Marshalls. I always wear black jeans or slacks so I don't really care about pants.

I really like unique shirts/prints and I want to have a little more fun with how I dress this year. More color, more crazy patterns. I'm looking for some websites that sell good quality, interesting t-shirts and button downs. Nothing too crazy busy like those all-over-print star nebulas but just, really cool, interesting designs I can wear under or with other things.

I like minimalist geometric deisgns. If I had to describe my style, I wear lots of sharp lines and clean cut designs. For example, one of my favorite shirts is a black polo with thin white piping on the collar and pocket. I like things that have a little extra touch of something. I also like really colorful, fun stuff too. I'm kinda all over the map but there's a consistent theme in there somewhere.

Here's an example of something I ordered. Most of the stuff on this site is way over the top, but I like stuff like the link below (preview image on top is not the same item). I'd probably wear this under a black button down or something.

269,malefashionadvice,"I recently bought a pair of RB1971v on https://www.smartbuyglasses.ca/. I paid $112 after price comparison ($157 originally. $212 in the official site However, Im not sure if the pair I got are authentic or a rep.

First of all, the Rayban logo is white at the top on the official website but mine are black at the bottom. Ive seen pictures online tho and some pairs have the black logo at the bottom.

Mine didnt come in a silver box but it came in a plastic bag with the luxottica sticker barcode thing. I assume the silver box are only for sunglasses. I have an authentic RB 3447v glasses from my optometrist and i think i remember it stored in a similar plastic bag as well. Im not sure tho

My rb3447v has “ray-ban"" engraved on the nosebridge. The 1971 doesnt. (I know engravings/prints are different on each model but I just want to make sure).

My 3447v is made in china while the 1971v is made in italy.

Both have the hidden “RB” printed on each nosepiece.

It didn’t come with a certificate of authenticity. I’m gonna keep assuming they only come in sunglasses and not on the rx ones lol

Ive attached some photos.

277,malefashionadvice,"Hey, everybody.

I'm going to start by saying that I have absolutely no sense of style whatsoever, which is why i'm here. I am in the process of moving across country for medical reasons. I have many medical problems but the most obvious one right now is my messed up back which forces me to walk with a cane. I'm moving to Arizona since the warm weather will be good for my back and help in my (very long) recovery. My entire family lives in Arizona and I haven't seen them in many years due to the distance. I'm underweight and kind of sickly looking right now as some things have been flaring up. I'm also pretty self conscious about seeing my family again with my cane for the first time. I'm only 27 years old so it's definitely out of the ordinary.

We just got under contract on a house in Arizona and will be moving in the next \~3 weeks. I figured if I'm gonna show up underweight and walking with a cane I might as well look fly AF. I'm tryin' to make that cane look good, you know what I'm saying? How do I do that?

I grew up dirt poor. My experience with clothing involves hand me downs and 5 packs of Hanes plain T-shirts. I've rarely ventured beyond that. But this is a big, life changing move. We're moving 2,000 miles away and starting completely over after a traumatic medical crisis. I figured it's the perfect time to get some style especially since I'll probably be very self conscious about the cane and seeing my Dad and family for the first time in years.

I'm currently walking with one of those collapsible metal canes from Walgreens. Does anybody know of a place to get some seriously stylish canes? Maybe something more modern. I don't mind splurging on it so money's not (too much) of a concern. Also, I'm 6'3"" and have always had trouble finding shirts that are long enough for me. If I stand up straight most shirts turn into belly shirts for me. Where could I find a place that sells long shirts or shirts for tall and skinny men?

Finally, remembering that I have no fashion sense whatsoever, I would appreciate any words of wisdom y'all could offer regarding men's fashion, style, or anything really. I'm just fed up with looking sick and crippled. Whatever advice you can give me to help combat that image would be much appreciated!

Thanks a bunch, everybody for reading my novel and thank you in advance for any advice this wonderful community offers. :)

290,malefashionadvice,"Thanks to the informativity of Wikipedia, I know that [tabi are technically socks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabi), so all of these boots/shoes have been named wrong for years.  They date back to the 15th century and in a closer-to-current form in the 20th century, when a brother of the founder of the Bridgestone Corporation decided to give them rubber soles and harder outers to basically serve as boots.  This seems like splitting hairs.

Now that I’ve established myself as an unquestionable expert, I should tell you that when I started looking for pictures for a Tabi Inspo Album, I quickly realized that some of the best work has already been pieced together and documented by others.  Therefore, the best thing I can do is to provide a quick history and summary of the Tabi (check and check), an overview of others’ notable works on the subject, and a bunch of pics _with a focus mostly on Redditors who’ve posted fits in Tabi_.

The tabi as most of you know it was popularized in modern fashion by Martin Margiela, under his eponymous house, Maison Margiela (nee Maison Martin Margiela), starting with collections in the late 1980s (unclear whether it was 1988 or 1989).  Since then, many other designers around the world have tried to get in on the split-toe action, including sneaker stalwarts like ASICS and Nike and contemporary labels like Vetements and Maharishi.

324,malefashionadvice,"Hi All,

Recently I've been adding pieces to my wardrobe as my clothing wears out and have been avoiding synthetic fabrics (read: reaching for organic hemp, cotton, and preferably wool) to avoid creating more microplastics and searching for sustainably sourced brands that also  treat their workers/suppliers fairly.

With that said, it's hard to hit all three, but what are some brands that you think embody any combination of the following:

* Ethical Practices - donations to causes, fair trade, have a great ethos and/or moral cause, etc.
* Use of Natural Fabrics (reasonably) - I like the feel of Lululemon shorts, but I do prefer to know that my clothing is made from natural materials. Poly/synthetic blends tend to hold odors (and aren't the healthiest to wear), aren't as anti-microbial, and release microplastics which are quite hard to clean up.
* Sustainable - working towards being carbon neutral/negative, promoting good agricultural/procurement practices, etc.
* Stylish (less of an emphasis) - this is pretty subjective and isn't that high on my list, but it's definitely nice given that I work as a accountant during the day.

I did some digging and found a [master list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethicalfashion/comments/aqvexd/2019_master_list_for_ethical_fashion_brands/) on r/ethicalfashion, but would optimally like to find brands that fit all three tenets.

326,malefashionadvice,"Has anyone else had a similar problem with Farfetch?  

I'm seeing reviews of people who have been pressured by Farfetch salespeople to keep re-ordering products to boost sales, but I don't know what to make of it.  They're a publicly traded company so I wouldn't think that a returned order would count towards profits.  Regardless, if this is a policy-backed sales tactic I'd like to know.  

Its really frustrating to deal with this company, their customer service reps kept telling me that they'd call me back with more details later that same day.  I emailed them every day for 3 days, asking when they'd be contacting me.  Farfetch never replied.   Finally, on the last day, I called back and told the sales rep that I really needed to talk to someone about my order.   They connected me to a manager and that's when he offered me a 10% discount on my order--half the discount they were already offering on all their products.   So, in consideration for my troubles, they offered to charge me 10% more than what I'd pay on the order.

# Recommendation for a boutonniere (+ pocket square combo?) for a dark plaid suit

Hi gents,

I figured I would group-think the room of stylish men. I have a decent suit (black plaid, well-fitted) that I want to enhance a bit for an upcoming event. (Not a wedding; industry conference and awards, to give you an idea.)

But I'm horrible with color coordination. What would you recommend for a dark black/gray plaid and white shirt combo?

343,malefashionadvice,"Off the bat, I'm not talking about a made-to-measure suit.

I'd like to have some truly custom pieces—jackets most likely—made. Think of one–off fashion pieces rather than a standard lounge suit jacket that's made to fit me perfectly: not just picking my own materials, but picking design elements from the bottom up and discussing structure, etc.

Essentially, I'd like to be a pincushion for a day and come out with something that's unusual, and impressive. I had a couple of friends who designed clothes like this (mostly for women) when I was younger, but neither of them do it now. Would a normal tailor take on an artistic job like this, or should I be looking for someone else? Who?","Custom Clothing: What's the process, and who do I approach?"

345,malefashionadvice,"So... just to start off: please forgive my formatting, I’m on mobile. 

I’m (25M) redoing my wardrobe since all I had for the longest time were hoodies, T-shirts, joggers, and sneakers. Since I start a new job soon, and I’m getting older, I want to have a more mature aesthetic; something like smart casual/ business casual. I already got myself a suit, 2 sport coats and a few pairs of dress shirts, chinos and dark wash jeans. All that’s really left is footwear and accessories.

I’m 5’9, and in the city I live in that’s on the shorter side, and I’m not in the greatest shape (200 pounds, never been in a gym, carry most of my weight in my thighs and a bit on my chest and love handles), so my wardrobe isn’t aggressively fitted. As such I’m leaning more towards combat style/ leather lace up boots. 

I was wondering what you guys would suggest in terms of what to look for in, as well as how to style, boots to appear taller, and I have a lot of questions about what to go with to look as tall as I can:

6 inch vs 8 inch boots? Capped vs plain toe? How high can the heel be before it looks too feminine? Pants tucked in? Stacked? Pin roll cuffed? Hemmed? Where should the pants hem be, relative to the boot? End right on top? As far down as possible without causing a break in the pant leg? Some point in between?

TL;DR: Pls help smol boi look less smol in boots

Thanks in advance",Boot tips/tricks to look taller?

* [**Below $100**](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/czmm74/your_favorite_for_noragi/eyz8hey?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Historically, we've been uncomfortable recommending boots in this range... But if your budget doesn't allow for anything more expensive, you still deserve the best recommendation we can give.
* [**$100 to $300**](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/czmm74/your_favorite_for_noragi/eyz8i09?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

**Next week we'll be doing T-shirts (another 2 year old thread)**

#Guidelines for posting here:
* I'll post price bins as top level comments. Post recommendations in response to a price bin, as a second level comment. You can also use top level comments for general info, inspo albums, and general questions.
* Recommendations can be a brand (""I like Kiton suits!"") or a strategy (""I go thrifting for suits!"").
* Try to stick to one brand/strategy per second-level comment. If you want to recommend both Alden and Carmina, post them separately so people can vote and discuss separately.
* Include a **link** in your second-level comment if you can -- if not to a purchase page, at least to images.
* Try to use prices you might realistically pay. That might be MSRP, or it might not -- it depends. If you're in a cheap bin, maybe the best buying strategy is to thrift, or wait for a big sale. If you're buying from a store like Banana Republic, paying full price is simply incorrect -- the only question is whether you'll get 40% off or 50% off. So factor that in.
* The bins are in USD, so either use a US price, or convert a non-US price to USD to pick the bin.

I really like the overall look and feel of these, but the left shoe has some pretty bad loose grain on the back piece of the upper. Honestly, for my intended purpose (occasional summer/vacation shoe) it wouldn't bother me as much if it was the same on both shoes. What bothers me most is that the leather isn't relatively consistent on each shoe. I guess I'm a little picky about symmetry.

I really like the look and feel of these, but the left shoe has some pretty bad loose grain on the back piece of the upper. Honestly, for my intended purpose (occasional summer/vacation shoe) it wouldn't bother me as much if it was the same on both shoes. What bothers me most is that it looks like the pair aren't the same. I guess I'm a little picky about symmetry. I could exchange but there's no guarantee the next pair will be any better.

I want to purchase my first Chelsea boots. I am thinking between these two :

* Timberland: [**https://www.timberland.co.uk/shop/en/tbl-uk/elmhurst-chelsea-boot-for-men-in-dark-brown-a26j8931**](https://www.timberland.co.uk/shop/en/tbl-uk/elmhurst-chelsea-boot-for-men-in-dark-brown-a26j8931) Color: Dark Brown
* Geox:  [https://www.geox.com/int/jaylon\_man-U94Y7G00023C6024.html](https://www.geox.com/int/jaylon_man-U94Y7G00023C6024.html) Color:Dark Taupe 

I am living in the Balkans, and right now we have a dry winter with no snow and with lowest to -10 and highest to 10 degrees Celsius.  Looking for Chelsea boots for any occasion, I am a programmer. 

My thought is that the Timberland is ok for right now, but are not ok for spring and autumn, they are not waterproof. 

For the Geox, I think they will be perfect for spring, autumn and not so harsh winters. Just the thing is that if I wanted to get a lighter color (sandy colors, in this case dark taupe) I would like to purchase Clarks Desert Boots :/ which I can't find them in stock right now. Also, I don't really like the look of the rubber sole on this. Crepe looks better but the rubber on the Geox is water repellant and breathable.

441,malefashionadvice,"I've noticed that BR has really taken things up a notch lately. From an environmental standpoint, they are using techniques that require less water and their new ""dry indigo"" uses 99% less water! They are also starting to use recycled polyester and cashmere. Normally I only expect this stuff from up starts like Ministry of Supply and Everlane. There is still work to be done on their packaging however. When you order online everything comes in plastic. Why not a cardboard box that can be recycled like Amazon? Why not wrap the individual items in thick paper like Everlane? Let's hope they keep getting better because they've made great strides as of late.

The clothes themselves have also gone up in terms of style and quality. Their pant line up is arguably one of the strongest there is. The traveler pants, traveler jeans, brushed traveler pant (these are super soft like Italian moleskin) and their chinos are all top notch. It's good to see them trying their own thing. No one else has pants that feel like the traveler do. The Core Temp pants are another incredible item. I have a full suit in this material and it's amazing in terms of a performance-type fabric. It uses  active particles derived from volcanic sand to warm you up or cool you down and it really does work. 

Suits have also gone up in quality and craftsmanship. A lot are now half or full canvass lined and the style and fits have gone way up from where they were a few years ago.

The Polo's are IMHO the best there is. Period. I have polo's from other places (like Polo and Everlane) but BRs Luxury-touch polo fabric is so much better. They also have way more styles and colours than anyone else. It's hard not to find what you are looking for.

What do I want to see in the near future? I would like them to build out their oxfords a bit more in terms of colours. I would also love to see some classic heavy rugby shirts with all those awesome rugby stripe colours. Maybe I just want them to go a bit more preppy than modern, but that's just me.

2) Sustainability - If possible the company should have a mindset of sustainability, trying ro recycle as much as possible, use GOTS certified organic cottons, offer repair services etc.

3) Design - I'm a fan of the more minimalistic, modern approach, simple and classic silhouettes, basic color palettes - basically the scandinavian type of fashion.

So here's a small list I compiled of a few fashion brands who mostly fulfill those criterias and are available in Europe (Switzerland). 


ALL:
•A Day's March
• ArmedAngels
• Asket
• Arket 
• Brothers We Stand
• Filippa K
• Klitmøller
• Know the Origin
• Kuyichi 
• RÆBURN
• Studio JUX
• Sunspel
• NN07
• NoLabel
• Norse Projects
• Uniforms for the Dedicated
• Unrecored
• Wax London (UK)


BASICS (T-Shirts, Sweaters):
• Colorful Standard (PT)
• SANVT

JEANS:
• Mud Jeans
• Nudie Jeans


MINIMAL SNEAKERS:
• Artisan Lab (IT)*
• Aurelien (IT)*
• Cinque Milano (IT)*
• Common Projects (IT)*
• Crown Northhampton (UK)
• ETQ Amsterdam (PT)
• Filling Pieces (PT)
• Garment Project (PT)
• Grenson (UK)
• JAK Shoes (PT)
• North 89 (IT)*
• Onism (PT)
• Scarosso (IT)*
• Svensson (IT)*
•Uniform Standard (PT)

SHIRTS:
• Carpasus (PT)
• Forét (PT)

Made in (IT) = Italy, (PT) = Portugal, (UK) = United Kingdom
* = Margom Sole

So I know there's still plenty of great brands missing. So please help me out, getting away from Made in China/Vietnam/India clothes. 
I also didnt consider US brands who produce in the EU but ship from the US (Koio, Oliver Cabell) since that doesnt make sense economically and ecologically. 

Thanks!",Minimal and sustainable european fashion brands

- All listings **must** be posted from reputable platforms like Grailed, Ebay, Depop, Poshmark, etc. 

- All transactions are to be conducted through these sites. If you go offsite, you do so at your own risk.

- **All disputes should be handled through Grailed/Ebay/Paypal.**
__________________________________

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers. 

- Ask for measurements if there aren't any. Tag sizes vary wildly. 

If you want to do a trade: 

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection.",Buy Sell Thread - January 20

I live in a developing country where brands and variety in clothes is   
1. Really limited  
2. Expensive due to customs  


I have a close relative visiting the New York in the last two weeks of February and they've given me a budget of \~$100 to get what I want. This is a rare opportunity for me so I thought I'd ask redditors living nearby for advice.  


**Style**: Smart Casual, 

**Climate:** Better if can be worn year round, climate is generally hot(40+ degree celsius summer, 6 degree at nights in winter) and humid

**Age**:mid 20's.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Shoes**

I love shoes. I have Stans, black suede casual boots and formal wear I'm content with, and am buying brown boots from here.  
 What else should I get that's versatile? I was considering  
\-Vans  
\-Killshots  
\-Adidas Samba  
\-Adidas Gazelle  
\-Timberland Boots??

Obviously I can't get them all, and the Adidas products are often available here (but more expensive)as well so I'd be grateful for any input,  


 2.  **T shirts**  


I was thinking of getting some plain uniqlo T shirts in different colours for regular wear in summer, base layer in winter/fall.  


3. **Sweaters**

Some sweaters in solid colours for spring/fall/winter  


&amp;#x200B;

Information that would help:  


* Which stores will be on sale at that time?  

* Which shops to check/avoid?  


Hopefully I'd be able to obtain a certain compromise between quality and quantity. I'd be happy with 2-3 items. Any other advice is welcome as well

50,malefashionadvice,"  This is my first time ever doing this, I don't really use Reddit that  much, but I figured this is as good as a place as any to look for shoe   help. I'm in the market for a different shoe, I have been buying Nike   for as long as I have had the ability to, but as of late I have been meaning to find a new brand. I chose my specific Nike shoe for simply   that they have relative style and in that past I used to get those sores   from rubbing on the back of my ankle .  The ankle sore is no longer an   issue as I have found socks that compensate for this. I'm trying to  look  for a shoe that is athletic with a durable sole. Durable enough so  that  I don't slip and slide every time a rainstorm shows up which  happens  with my Nike's. I walk a lot and live in a warm climate if that  matters.  Basically I've looked around myself and without much  experience I am  unsure of what to lookout for. This is probably a lot  of information,  but I figured more is better. Oh and my budget is up to $80 and a  little more if I have to. 

tldr: Looking for shoes

* budget of 80 or more if nesesscary
* durable sole
* athletic i.e good for the gym
* stylish if possible",Looking for new shoes

54,malefashionadvice,"I am so horrible at this fashion thing, and I figured the thing is, I'm looking for such a particular niche style that it's hard to even follow most of the general/standard advice and tips online. So I figured I'd ask if some of you experts could give their insight on this.

First of all, right now I have about a dozen designer T-shirts of different colours, mostly black or white though, 6 pairs of jeans (dark/dress black, casual black, white, blue, dark navy, grey). And then I have plain basic T-shirts that I like to wear most of the time. I have quite a few pairs of shoes, maybe 10 in total. I usually end up wearing the plain basic T's with jeans and the same 2-3 shoes most of the time, unless I go somewhere special then I use the rest.

But my problem is that I'm feeling like I *always look the same*, wear the same thing and have no clothes lol, maybe I'm just super conscious about it when I look at my pictures and others don't notice? idk I doubt it though. So anyway I'm going to be doing a shift in my life and figured I might as well also shift my style with it in the process, so I decided to invest in an entirely new wardrobe, basically going all-out on this, but at the same time not too crazy.. (maybe $20-30k in total, preferably not on the higher end of that range)

My main question is how to go about deciding the number of items to buy in each category (t-shirts, jeans, shirts, shoes/sneakers, etc.). My main inspiration and obsession right now is dress shirts (LV mainly, the casual ones), and Dior sneakers and T's. I basically want to buy several of those, but I know it could rack up $$ really quick so I wanna be smart about it. I also realized I might wanna buy 2 jackets as I only have 1 designer jacket right now, I live in a hot place so I don't need jackets 99% of the time, but it's good to have, especially for traveling. I figured those are what could eat up most of the budget though, tried to put down notes of several items I had on my mind and they quickly totalled to my budget, which made me come here to ask what everyone thinks as I might want to add more of certain items and less of others, for example I'd hate to go buy 2 designer jackets and a bunch of shoes, maybe a few t-shirts and then realize I forgot to put aside some money for jeans.

I browsing through HUGO BOSS's sale and stumbled upon two polos that appeared to be the same and yet different.

*1. [Slim-fit polo shirt in baby piqué with tipping stripes](https://www.hugoboss.com/us/slim-fit-polo-shirt-in-baby-pique-with-tipping-stripes/747476933769.html)
*2. [Slim-fit polo shirt in stretch-cotton piqué](https://www.hugoboss.com/us/slim-fit-polo-shirt-in-stretch-cotton-pique/747476629396.html)

Judging off of their titles, I figured that the material itself is what was different between the two. One being ""baby piqué"" and the other being ""stretch-cotton piqué"". (I don't actually know what either of these mean.) I figured the stretch one contained some sort of elastic fabric giving it the, well, stretch. However, when you scroll down to the MATERIAL AND CARE section, you will find that both comprise of 92% Cotton, 8% Elastane. So I guess they both have ""stretch"" then?

I actually chatted with HUGO BOSS to see if I could get an answer, but the agent seemed to be guessing as much as I was.

The only thing I could think of is that even though the polos are made of 92% cotton that the cotton itself is different.",Can you tell me what the difference is here? (HUGO BOSS Polos)

I still like the look of (brand new) dark raw denim, and I originally thought dark wash jeans were synonymous with raw denim, but now realize that pre-washed jeans can still come in similar dark washes. So I'd like to find a pre-washed but dark pair (slim/tapered fit; and probably prefer sanforized and slight preference to selvedge but open to others), which brings me to a few questions:

1. Is there an easy way to tell whether a pair of jeans is pre-washed or raw? Can you tell just by looking at them? Is there any terminology to look for in the tags?

2. Can crocking still happen with pre-washed jeans that are dark?

3. Any known recommended brands for a good pair of dark pre-washed jeans? Ideally no more than about $80-90, but any price point is welcome for a suggestion. (I've heard Levi's is often recommended for this, but I just can't help but want to avoid their branding with the red tag and back pocket pattern.

130,malefashionadvice,"I'm 5'7"" 180lbs that regularly weight lifts.

 I recently tried on a thigh length down parka but am torn between a size small or medium.

The small looks fantastic and fits like a well-fitted suit, however there would only be room for a dress shirt or thin long sleeve underneath. It fits perfectly now but I am a bit concerned if i pack on any more muscle I'd have trouble fitting into it.

The medium fits roomy with enough space underneath for a thick sweater, however the sleeves go way past my knuckles and the coat just looks very big on me.

Since it's a ridiculously warm parka, I don't have any intention of layering underneath. I prefer the trim look of the small, however I have concerns it might be too restricting.

Questions:

1. Is there a ""break in"" period for a down parka where the down loses some initial loft, loosening up the fit?
2. How fitted/roomy should a winter down parka be in general?
3. How long should the sleeves be?",How is a winter down parka supposed to fit?

My last misadventure turned me to The Jacket Maker, which does do ""economic"" made-to-fit but which I don't recommend. The jacket I got looked like the cheap Wish knockoff of the jacket I ordered.

To actually get to the point of my post, I like shearling style coats, which I blame on Lean Kennedy. Shearling is also usually very expensive, but I was able to find Overlands Sheepskin B-3:

Still not cheap, but they seem to be the cheapest in this style I've found. I've seen people say Overland is usually pretty good, but a bit overpriced, so I was wondering if that extended to these. In addition any recommendations of good alternatives? I'm not afraid of faux but know next to nothing about faux sherling other than H&amp;M sells it, which isn't really a mark of quality. Only other I've found in this price range is Goosecraft, a brand I've found even less about:

I'm a new lurker of this sub who has for a while wanted to dress better. I'm really quite thankful for all the infographics I've seen from sorting top/all time and I now have new mission to invest a little more energy into my day-to-day wardrobe. I'm a few weeks from 19 years old and in the rare financial position that I have enough money from scholarship rollover to think about buying a few items for myself.

Here's where I am: day-to-day rotation is usually a school-branded t-shirt, Old Navy or Goodfellow sweater, Old Navy jeans, and black Vans/olive green Birks. I really want to branch out from dressing like a sexagenarian while also keeping frugality in mind (I am in college, after all.) I own OCBD's in blue and white, a decent charcoal suit, and a tux, since I am a music student and both of those later items can be put into my ""dress code"" category. My dress shoes are bicycle stitch since I bought them waaaaaay before I knew anything about shoes.

Here's what's up: I've done a TON of lurking but that doesn't mean I know what I'm saying, so PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong. Chinos, bomber jackets, and killshot-esque shoes appear to be the most common recommendations across the board in terms of men in the same position where I am. I usually keep my eye on Ebates and Honey for good online shopping, and there is a Plato's Closet near me.

I would seriously be incredibly appreciative of any help anyone on here can offer. I've seen so many encouraging posts on here and I have a rough idea of how I think I want to look, I just lack the hindsight to know where to start.

162,malefashionadvice,"Background: I bought 4 suits in 2019, 2 from Charles Tyrwhitt (CT) in February and 2 from Indochino in July. All 4 suits were replacing  older suits.

Indochino Fit: I ordered my suits in their Chicago location,  they required alterations twice,  pants came in 2 inches too big around the waist and after first alteration too tight. It took 2-3 weeks between alterations, I was ok with the wait,  just wanted to get the fit right, and at the end they did get it right.

In store customer service: for all 3 visits the in store experience felt like I was fast food, I felt rushed and their store people seemed  bothered to have to work. In contrast every CT experience buying suits or several times buying dress shirts, has been significantly better at their Oakbrook IL store. 

The look: both suits look great and fit well, from this aspect I am happy. I love the color and patterns of both suits, and all the customizations from the inner linings to the other details. 

Quality: this is where I am most disappointed at. The fabric while beautiful seem thin, and the seams seem to be weak. I already have had 2 suspender buttons from 1 pair of pants fall off, while I have not even used the suspenders yet. 2 of my belt loops on the same pant seem to have stretched and are showing wear and tear. I have owned some suits for 20+ years, and have not witnessed this kind of wear and tear, in contrast my slightly older CT suits have had zero issues, and 1 of the CT suits has gotten significant use. The other challenge is wrinkling, 1 of the  Indochino suits seem to wrinkle up easier. I rotate 8+ suits at work and all 6 other suits wrinkle less. 1 thing I did that I am very happy about is buy 2 pairs of pants for the 1 suit, I expect this to extend the longevity of the 1 suit.

At the end of the day, I like the look and feel of the suits,  but I recognize that I will probably get to wear them significantly less than other suits. I plan not to shop there again in the near future,  but if you do, ensure the fabric is quality fabric and get 2 pairs of pants.","6 months later, my indochino suit experience"

248,malefashionadvice,"Hi MFA, just a quick question. I've been lurking here for a few months, learning and using the resources as I try and rebuild my wardrobe into something more fashionable and professional, but I saw a jacket I loved in the wild this morning and for the life of me I can't figure out what kind of jacket it was -- so I figured maybe someone here would be able to help.

Someone walked out of the coffee shop as I was walking in, and I had just enough time to notice the jacket and compliment him on his jacket as we passed each other. In that split second I didn't want to impose while he was headed out, and now I'm kicking myself for not asking where he found it.

The jacket reminded me a bit of a pea coat, except with a much thinner/lighter material, especially with the front pockets, but had some elements that reminded me of a blazer, with the bottom of the jacket being more rounded in the front as opposed to the squared corners I'm used to seeing in pea coats.

For a visual, I'd say it was kind of a cross between [a pea coat like this](https://www.mauvetree.com/product/men-grey-long-wool-pea-coat/) and [a blazer like this](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=488750002&amp;vid=1&amp;CAWELAID=120302000001799524&amp;tid=brpl000011&amp;kwid=1&amp;ap=7&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA04XxBRD5ARIsAGFygj-4rjFqS-H7l4pPahZNPVxJ3Jw_KjuvvUrpsbIJJ3RDMOdgZ7YLNFMaAr-7EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds#pdp-page-content), with the pockets, button-style, and I think the cuffs looking more like the pea coat but the shape and thinness of the material a bit more like the blazer. The collar had to be somewhere in between -- it buttoned up higher on the chest than a blazer (he had a scarf on and tucked into it) -- but it wasn't anywhere near as big as the collar on the linked pea coat.

Hopefully this makes sense to someone; I still don't have a great vocabulary for fashion, but such is the learning process. Thanks in advance if anyone has some ideas!",Jacket Question from a Newbie

Been continuing to make moves revamping my wardrobe and getting rid of stuff that I don't really wear anymore. I've got some stuff that I'd like to add in the coming months and looking for suggestions:

- Charcoal or tan grey wool blend coat: this is more of a ""very soon"" item on my list. Would like to keep it below $200. Seen some sharp looking ones of ASOS but suspicions about quality have kept me from ordering.

- Olive green jacket: I'm more gearing this towards the spring. Seen some nice ones on Allsaints on sale. I've read a lot about their seude and leather jackets; not so much about their other stuff. 

- High top sneakers: Looking at a few different colors (black white, brown). Anyone have anything interesting other than Converse? 

Chukkas (or similar): I have a pair of Clark's Busachres and they're really comfortable. Might do a classic desert boot in a different color. Any other recommendations? Around $150 max.

If I take a T shirt into a tailor, will I be able to ask him to do the following;

Take the hem up so that it is not as long

Take the sleeves up a bit higher so they sit just above my triceps

make the sleeve slightly tighter around my arm

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to get these done how much would it cost roughly and is this all doable? If it helps I had him take up the hem on a dress shirt and it cost £14 ($18.50 approx)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a problem where I like wearing Tees that show off the gains, most of them do however I have changed my preferred brand because the new one is cheaper, the fabric feels nicer and they fit a bit better than my previous.

I have pretty big arms and shoulders, 44"" chest and I'm 6ft (all legs) 

The problem with my proportions is my torso is short, when I buy a tee that fits well enough to make my arms and shoulders look good without being too tight its usually pretty long, that is my main issue. I want my top to sit at pocket height with my jeans just grazing the opening. These ones however go a bit lower than I would like and it looks kinda goofy with my long legs. The sleeves are also quite long almost covering my whole bicep leaving a couple of inches above my elbow which I don't like, because I am sizing up to make sure things aren't too tight the sleeves also get a big baggier which isn't me desired look, my 16"" and a bit arms don't quite hug the sleeves as well as I would like because I'm sizing up a bit more. I would like these somehow made a bit tighter.

&amp;#x200B;

As I see it, I'm going to need two 'outfits': a 'very smart' dinner suit, and a 'less smart'... at least a pair of chinos and a blazer with shirts/ties to switch out. It's probably quite relevant that I mention that I'm in the UK, but am free to pop over to shop in the US too. 

I have so many questions.

How/where do I buy the dinner suit? Does it need to be tailored? What shop would I go to? How do I know if it fits right?
What sort of blazer do I need? Lapels? How many buttons? What material? 
Do I wear the same shoes for the 'very' and 'less' smart? What sort of shoes? 
What sort of shirts do I need to go with the two outfits?
What colour bow tie for the dinner suit?
Cummerbund? Like... What?!
What am I missing?

287,malefashionadvice,"I've never been fashion conscious or informed - even less so than the typical guy, which makes me very insecure on my own opinion on anything fashion related - especially my own. However, I'm from Texas but moving to the Northeast and recently gave dressing up very Western a shot and I think I pull it off quite well. 

We're talking practically full Cowboy. I got a nice felt Stetson hat, some nice Wrangler jeans (first new pair of jeans I've gotten in 10 years), bolo tie, and some clean solid color button up long sleeve shirts.

I'm still looking for boots as I know nothing about them and don't wanna screw that up but also don't want to spend $250+ on them.

Ultimately, I feel the look is very clean, simple, and easy. In Texas I don't really get a lot of attention, however in the Northeast I'm worried I'll feel very out of place - like I'm a lost cosplayer. This feeling is probably mostly because I haven't rocked the look much at all yet and this is the first time I've given a 'style' a try before. I know confidence makes any 'style' pay off, but this is new waters for me in more ways than one and confidence won't come before experience - whether positive or negative.

310,malefashionadvice,"Hey everyone,

I've been looking to buy a casual dress shoe that I could wear with a button up and chinos/jeans when I'm going out to a late night event. Through some of the posts I've been reading, it seems my best bet would be a derby/blucher - a mix of casual, formal, and versatile. I've seen a lot of recommendations for Allen Edmonds but a lot of them still seem a little too formal (not to mention, pricey) for what I was looking for. Anyways, I stumbled across these Red Wing derbies and they looked exactly what I was looking for in a casual shoe (color, style, price). I was wondering if anyone had any remarks regarding these shoes before I make the jump and buy them. Here's the link: [Red Wing Derby](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/product/3056242/Williston%20Leather%20Derby?color=TEAK%20FEATHERSTONE&amp;sid=972549%40cm_sp)

I also saw the brand Meermin frequently recommended and I did kind of like there version of a derby as well. It's just I like the color and style of the Red Wings a little bit more. But maybe the Meermin's are that much more worth getting? Here's the link:[Meermin Derby](https://www.meermin.es/in_en/10152816170000he-17-101528-dark-brown-country-calf-e-marron.html)

333,malefashionadvice,"I live in the UK, and I ordered a pair of Terracotta Captain Thursday Boots to hopefully last me a few years, as I've never had a solid pair of boots that lasted a while. I'm usually a size UK 9 in dress shoes &amp; most sneakers, but sometimes a 9.5. Since Thursday Boots recommend wearing a size down from your normal, I decided to go with a size 9.  


Upon trying them on, I think they look great, and they do fit me, but they're quite tight around my feet, and I'm debating whether or not I should return them, so I need some advice.

  
Had I been living in the States, I would be able to return them for free, but since I'm in the UK I would have to pay the shipping costs. On top of that, I'm a student, so I need to save all the money I possibly can; but at the same time, I would like to make sure the size is right because they're quite expensive boots, and if I want them to last me a while, the size needs to be right.  


I know leather is a bit stiff out of the box, and is supposed to mould to your feet, but how much will it do that? My big toe and pinkie are both touching the sides of the boots, and there's about 2cm of space to the end of the boots, which really isn't a lot. I can tell that I definitely won't get blisters but they're a bit uncomfortable to walk in because my toes are quite squished up at the end.

338,malefashionadvice,"First I'd like to say thank you to all of the very knowledgeable people on here who helped my tremendously with choosing new suits. Prior, I had a number of older suits of varying quality and fit that I had accumulated over many years. These were all donated to make way for a refresh. I was looking for a 40 short suit, slim fit, standard 6"" drop. I'm 5'9"", 175lbs, muscular build across the shoulders and in the legs and a few extra pounds in the belly. My biggest issue when buying clothes is finding a good fit in the upper legs.

After extensive reading on Reddit and elsewhere, I narrowed it down to the following (in descending order of cost):

- Brooks Brothers Milano
- Suit Supply Lazio or Havana
- J.Crew Ludlow slim fit
- Banana Republic slim fit Italian wool

I ended up not even trying Suit Supply as I had already found stuff I liked but as for the others:

**Ordering and Customer Service**

- Brooks Brothers: I shopped in store but was disappointed to discover that they didn't have *any* Milano cut suits in stock. I was able to look at fabrics and tried on a Regent fit suit. The pants actually fit reasonably well and could have been tailored to a nice fit but the jacket hung like a sack. The sales person was quite knowledgeable but really tried to make the sale on a Regent whereas I went ahead with ordering Milano online (1x Milano Plaid 1818 and 1x Milano stretch-wool 2 button 1818)
- J.Crew: They only had 1 slim-fit style/color in stock (Navy) but the sales person was great and assured me that the quality control was good and that any of the suits in the lineup will fit exactly the same. I ordered 3x Ludlow slim-fit, one in each color (light blue, charcoal, navy)
- Banana Republic: Good selection in store but no sales help. It was all sold as separates and it was a bit difficult to find the right sizes. In the end I went home and ordered 1x slim italian wool and 1x houndstooth wool.

**Quality**

- Brooks Brothers: To my untrained eye, the fabric and construction was a head and shoulders above the others. I was very impressed with the overall quality and couldn't find any faults.
- J.Crew: The wool felt very nice and I checked everything over carefully for construction faults. Couldn't really find anything though. My one complaint was that the suit I liked the best (harbor blue) has an ugly white striped lining. Overall though I was very happy.
- Banana Republic: Two very different results with the 2 suits. The houndstooth was terrible (navy, no longer on the website). The fabric looked worn and was kind of fuzzy and the lining was a butterfly style for warm weather. I probably didn't read the description well enough but it definitely looked a lot worse than the website pics. The italian wool one was much nicer though. It was obviously lower quality than the other ones but still looked great and actually fit the best of all pre-tailoring. I liked the peak lapels and the overall look of the suit a lot. One annoyance was that they sewed a cleaning instructions label into the lining seam where it is very visible. I tried to remove it but didn't want to damage anything so it will be a job for the tailor.

**Fit**

- All of the jackets fit rather nicely with a little bit of tailoring needed for the arms length only.
- For the pants though, the Milano cut was *far* to slim in the thighs. I think it would be more comparable to the extra-slim from the other lines. The waist too was a lot tighter despite being the same size. It wouldn't have been a problem to let out a little (salesperson said +1.5"" max) besides the cost and hassle of extra tailoring.
- Pants for the ludlow and BR fit great right out of the box with just some minor tailoring for length needed.

**Price**

- I was pretty happy with the prices I got from all three companies. I already had a Gap credit card for BR and I got ones for BB and JC as well for the extra discount. After Christmas is a good time to buy suits!
- Brooks Brothers: Original price was 1x $1,198 and 1x 998 but sale was 2 for $1,190. After the new credit card discount, the total was $1,004 including 6.25% tax, so **$502** each. Not worth the full price though as the quality jump wasn't as big as the price jump.
- J.Crew: Original price was $650 but I got a 1 day cardholders sale of -25% so **$496.50** each including tax. Great price but barely less than BB. Probably worth it at full price if you needed something quickly but otherwise a great deal at the sale price.
- Banana Republic: Full price was $568 but I got a great deal here at **$300** each (no tax for some reason). I think additional sales can go as low as $250. At these prices they are well worth it but definitely not at full price. These suits are perfect budget options if you need to wear one everyday and can save the nicer suits for more important events (which is my plan).

In the end I kept all three J.Crew Ludlows and the Banana Republic Italian wool. I hope this helps someone else going through the same process. Good luck!","Non-expert suit comparison: Brooks Brothers, Ludlow, Banana Republic"

345,malefashionadvice,"I'll start by saying that my complaint with Taft pertains to their QC. I ordered a pair of boots from them and they came in with a noticeable blemish on the suede. I was advised by some people on this Reddit to exchange them. The replacement pair that I received still has blemishes on the suede, granted to a lesser degree than the first pair, but they seem to have been worn for a day or two. The sole leather is pretty scuffed up and there is some light creasing at the toe box. I dropped $250 on a NEW pair of boots, not a pair that has been lightly used. Doesn't Taft disallow sending back shoes that have been work anyway? After receiving two pairs of boots that I find to be of questionable quality, I have to ask; does Taft even have QC? The boots are out of stock once again in a size 10, so if I exchange them then how long would I be waiting for the replacement? Would I get another pair of used boots? What is going on here Taft?

346,malefashionadvice,"I'm hoping this sub can help me out with something that I've been struggling to find for years.  The unicorn of shoes.  Long story short, I travel for work a lot. I prefer to travel minimally so I bring only 1 pair of shoes... and that's typically my sneakers because comfort is paramount.  I own several pairs of well made dress shoes, but I never wear them (except for super formal occasions) even to the office.  I wear my sneakers or my boots (western style/cowboy).  That's it.  However, I find myself looking a bit too casual... a lot.  So what I am searching for is a shoe that is very comfortable, not formal, but not casual, that can stand up to the riggers of my work and travel.

These shoes should look at home in the board room and in the field.  My role at work often has me in front of customers, in board meetings, and at various locations climbing ladders, installing gear, pulling cables, and literally in the field.  So the shoes can't be too needy for maintenance.  They need to look good out and about in a casual environment (both pants and shorts preferably - pants a must), as well as look at home when I am in front of the customer or the board.  Above all, they must be comfortable.  If they aren't, they'll join the many dress shoes I have relegated to the back of the closet.

Budget: Up to $350 or so

To give you an idea of what I wear:

Typically pants (Flint &amp; Tinder 365 are my favorites)

Merino polos (sometimes smooth cotton polos)

Solid color Tees (Buck Mason are my favorites ATM)

Shorts: typically something in the line of the THFlex type

Hopefully you guys can point me in the right direction.",Help please! Looking for the Unicorn of shoes

I seem to have issues buying suits, more specifically the jacket portion.

I have a chest of 43"" however my arms are in between the regular sleeve and the long sleeve with long being just too long for me and regular being painfully short.

Another problem is when I go in and they measure me they'll give me a range of regular and slim fit jackets to try however I'm always told ""it fits your chest but your shoulders are too broad for the jacket"" it usually pulls and crinkles on the shoulders and a lot of the time pulls the sleeves up!

The ONLY well fitting suit I have was a Slim fit jacket however it was an L fit, it was also a 44"" chest, the idea was I needed a suit desperately and the woman came to the conclusion that the slim fit in a 44"" would be tight on the shoulder which would pull the sleeves up and make the Long sleeve fit look pretty good on me for length.

The problem here is that this is the situation with this one suit. Not anything else.

Do I really have to break the bank getting a tailored suit to get something that fits nice? I was happy enough to pay the £150 for the 3 piece I got but anywhere I'm seeing that do tailored suits is upwards of £300",tips for suits when you're muscular?

412,malefashionadvice,"Hey all,

With 2020 off and running, and the wonderful /u/citaro and /u/setfiretoflames stepping down (big thanks to them and everything they've done for the sub!!), we're looking to recruit a couple more moderators. With more than 2 million subscribers we'd love some more help with moderating this community.

We'd also appreciate some more diversity in timezones; the moderator team is pretty heavily concentrated in the USA.

**IF YOU HAVE IDEAS ABOUT HOW MFA AND WOULD LIKE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE IDEAS, THIS IS THE THREAD FOR THAT**

If the idea is to shut down the subreddit, we're keeping that on the backburner. For now.

If you would like to nominate another user, this thread is the place to do it.

**And if you would like to be a moderator, please make a TOP-LEVEL comment with responses to the following questions:**

- How much time per week do you spend on MFA?

- What do you think about the current condition of the subreddit--i.e., what's good/bad, and why?

- What changes, if any, would you like to implement?

- Why do you think you can be an effective moderator?

- Do you bring any other skills or assets to the table? (CSS, /u/automoderator config, community management, etc)

- Are you interested in adding content to the MFA wiki/sidebar?

We will take all nominations into consideration and decide who to add to the moderating team. This thread will be in contest mode. The highest-voted individual(s) will not necessarily get the job --we're doing this ""public interview"" kind of thing so we can get an idea of who the community supports as well.

___

FAQ:

*How much time are moderators supposed to put in?*

Nothing is set in stone. The Internet shouldn't get in the way of real life, and new commitments come and go. You can put in however much time you feel comfortable with giving. The idea is that there's enough of us on the team to chip in.

Content creation is not mandatory. Individual mods are free to contribute how much they want.

*Is there any 'training'?*

We have an introductory page and resources for moderators which give a rundown of what and how we do stuff. This includes some official resources from Reddit Inc.

There's also 'on the job training' for lack of a better term.

*What do you do on a daily basis?*

Mainly? Checking modmail and respond. Action comments or posts which have been flagged for spam or offensive words. Removing some posts and redirecting users to the correct recurring threads.

*Do you still offer the Uniqlo MFA mod discount code or similar?*

Sadly there is no financial benefit to being a MFA mod. That includes free products.

*Why would anyone want to be a moderator then?*

I have no idea, but somehow some crazy people still do.",Call for Moderator Nominations &amp; Applications

414,malefashionadvice,[removed],Anyone know any companies that seek decent quality rings without obliterating my wallet?
415,malefashionadvice,"Hello all. 

TL;DR My SLP wyatts still feel uncomfortable after 4 months of constant wearing. Is this normal? What can I do? 

So about 4 months ago I decided to bite the bullet on a pair of boots that I’ve wanted for about 3 years. The boots in question are the SLP black calfskin Wyatt harness boots (FW19 I believe). I still think no other boot is as good looking as they are (I know, very original) 

Well anyway, for about 4 months now I’ve been wearing them very regularly (about 4 days out of a week) and while I am very happy with my purchase in terms of how they look, the comfort has been honestly pretty disappointing. 
In terms of sizing, I’m normally a 43 in all of my shoes (sneakers and other low cost boots) but for these I read that for calfskin it’s good to half size as the leather will stretch. 
So I did just that and got them in a 42.5 eu (which I deeply regret as I think that this might be the root of my problem). 

My right foot is slightly wider than my left foot so usually I get the same areas affected. 
The toes (and my foot as a whole) on my right foot tend to feel more squashed and trapped. On top of that, I keep getting the same blisters on my left pinky toe and on the heel of my right foot. Also, my right foot messes with my ankle and calf a bit (my right leg is dominant). Overall, they’re not unwearable but the discomfort is definitely noticeable enough to warrant concern and irritation.  
Keep in mind I’m very lanky and skinny so my feet are quite narrow respective to my body type. 

Basically, what I’m asking all of you (specifically those with experience with these boots) is: 

Is what I’m going through normal? Are my expectations too high in terms of comfort and wearing them? Should I just wait it out? 
Are they not meant to be worn this often or seen as “everyday boots”? 

I read somewhere that Doc Martens take 100 hours or something to break into but it’s been way more than 100 hours wearing these bad boys and they’re still uncomfortable enough to be noticeable. I know they’re not sneakers but I had the impression that a broken in pair of leather boots would still feel amazing regardless. These do not. They almost have a mind of their own where some days they feel better than others. In terms of comfort I’d probably give my boots like an overall 6 (at most a 7) which for me is pretty inexcusable given the price and legacy. 
Keep in mind I’ve never owned any leather boots in this high quality or with such a high heel so maybe this is “initiation” or something for my feet but I somehow doubt that it would last for 4 months. 

Sorry for the long overly detailed post but I’m honestly desperate at this point to figure out what is the problem and how to get rid of it completely and I feel like every detail might matter. I really do love them and respect them aside from this glaring issue and I really want to wear them pretty much everyday without that “insecure”, nagging feeling on my feet. I’d greatly appreciate any feedback, insight or tips from anyone. 

Thank you in advance.",Help regarding YSL Wyatt black leather harness boots

**How's everyone doing? Just checking in with everyone**

* Everyone feeling ok?

* Did you already fail?

* Do you want to start again? 

* What are you looking forward to?

* What rules have you set for yourself? 

For those that didn't see the [initial post](https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/eiyj00/no_new_jawnz_january/) see below on what it is. 

---

**No (New) Jawnz January**

**Also Referred to as No Buy or No Cop January**

Jawnz: Internet vernacular for essentially clothing. A term popularized online ~~by Four Pins~~ some Korean jacket makers 

**What is No New Jawnz/No Buy/No Cop January?**

Exactly as it sounds its a self imposed limit on purchasing new clothing. This is a personnel challenge, not any sort of community mandated event.

**When is it?**

Officially it runs through January 2020. However if you do make it through the entire month I might extend the challenge to keep it going another month or just seeing how long you can go until you do purchase something. 

**What are the rules?**

As stated this is self-imposed which means you can adopt the rules that you would like to engage with. See some examples below but feel free to adjust or add based on your personnel belief
 (Taken from /u/thewardrobenerd's [FFA Low/No Buy: January - March 2020](https://old.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/efvy1f/ffa_lowno_buy_january_march_2020/) post on /r/femalefashionadvice 

&gt;* Buy nothing whatsoever.
&gt;* Reduce the *number* of items you buy (such as the [20 in 2020 challenge](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6IweobnvP-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)).
&gt;* Reduce the monthly or quarterly *amount* you spend.
&gt;* Create a list of what you will need and only purchase those items.
&gt;* Only buy from a certain type of retailer such as [not buying new](https://www.instagram.com/notbuyingnew/?hl=en) or only buying from local small businesses.
&gt;* For each item you want to buy but don’t, donate a certain percentage of money to your charity of choice or put a certain amount in a savings account.
&gt;* Do something more extreme - [only wear one outfit](https://mymodernmet.com/julia-mooney-one-outfit-100-days-project/) or [don’t shop at all](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/opinion/sunday/shopping-consumerism.html).

**Why should I participate in No Jawnz/No Cop January?**

Some potential reasons that you may be interested in are:

* Simply just saving money for future purchases
* Taking time to appreciate your current wardrobe and the clothing that you do have 
* Wearing through your closet might give you a greater understanding of gaps or holes in your wardrobe

**I want to do this, but I don’t know how to be successful.** (Again taken from /u/thewardrobenerd's [FFA Low/No Buy: January - March 2020](https://old.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/efvy1f/ffa_lowno_buy_january_march_2020/) post on /r/femalefashionadvice 

&gt;* Evaluate your current spending habits and create guidelines that are less than your current habits but still attainable. 
&gt;* Be clear in your motivation for doing this - Are you trying to save money? Trying to escape [hyperconsumerism](https://blackminimalists.net/blog/the-effects-of-hyper-consumerism)? Trying to be more creative with what you already have? 
&gt;* Unsubscribe, unfollow, and mute/hide social media accounts/emails that tempt you.
&gt;* If you do find something you want, put it on a list and reevaluate later. Sometimes saying “maybe later” rather than “not at all” is enough to satisfy the urge.
&gt;* Remember that breaking your rules once (or twice or three times) doesn’t ruin your entire no/low buy. If you buy something you weren’t planning on, it doesn’t mean you have to give up completely.

I had planned on buying a new suit, giving fabric scraps to my groomsmen along with a tie and pocket square. The rest would be up to them to 'match' beyond picking a general shoe color, shirt color and shirt collar shape/type. You know casual.


So off to suit shopping for me. Where I find [THIS TUX](https://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/black-tie-collection/washington-brown-tuxedo/P5990I.html?cgid=black-tie-collection&amp;prefn1=mainCategory&amp;prefv1=Suits%7CJackets%3Ffrom%3Doverview-suits%7CJackets&amp;pdp=true)and now I'm stuck. There are so many obvious reasons not to do this but mostly it just isn't as practical or versatile as other suits.


But, let's make excuses. If I wear a tux should my groomsmen also wear tuxes? Could I still consider suits for them? How do I even reasonably ask them to match this color? Maybe black suits? Should I just drink away the memory of this tux and hope I never stumble across is again?

12,malefashionadvice,"I've been trying to step up my casual dress code from jeans/t-shirts to a something more classical (that 1920s through 1940s look that I can't help but love). I'm interested in wearing a nice silk tie, shiny wingtips or oxfords, suspenders instead of a belt, and a suit; maybe even a woolen trench coat and hat depending on the weather (I live in BC, Canada where Summer is the only season without rain and windstorms, so you have to dress protectively).

Unfortunately, at the point where I'm wearing a tie, people start to comment and ask if I'm going to some formal event; anything more than that and they treat me like I'm wearing a costume instead of being a person who *genuinely* loves the classical aesthetic and wants to wear it as a default.

My dad can pull it off just fine, but me, I look ridiculous.

TL;DR: Barbour Bedale fits weird and sleeves are short but I still love it. 

Gents,

Please take a look at the photos of me in my Barbour Bedale purchased from End.co in November. This is a size 38. I sized down from 40. If you asked me my typical jacket size I would probably say 42. 

I’ve wanted this jacket forever and absolutely love it, but I need some input please:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do you think it fits? Why does it pooch out in the front like that?
2. Sleeves: they’re short. And I kind of like the look, but when I see guys with the same jacket and the sleeves are a more typical length, I’m jealous. I don’t really like seeing the knit cuff all the time. 
3. Is there anything to be done? I’ve seen some pics of the factory repair where they add a couple of inches and I don’t think that’s such a great look. I read the post where the guy buys another larger jacket with longer sleeves on sale, and has Barbour Frankenstein his jacket back together. Doesn’t seem likely to happen. 
4. Can I tailor the overall body so the front is more snug?
5. Is there a reasonable fix for the sleeves?

In short, MFA community, I put myself in your hands. Please pull no punches, I need to know what y’all think, and most of all, what are your ideas for a way forward. 

Thanks!

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers. 

- Ask for measurements if there aren't any. Tag sizes vary wildly. 

If you want to do a trade: 

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection.",Buy Sell Thread - January 13

I ordered some wool shirts from pendleton.. thumbs up.

I ordered some Moleskin shirts from J Peterman.  thumbs up.  

In my search, I noticed that a shirt on J Peterman's website was labeled, in their website pictures, with a tag that said ""guideboat"".

I've come across a brand called [Hynes Eagle](https://hyneseagle.com/) on a YouTube video and became curious as I found it to look visually pleasing and had a somewhat practical design. I did more research on the brand, but found almost no exposure, and began speculating that it could be a cheaper brand that is a supplier for larger chains like Walmart...

Has anyone used Hynes Eagles' backpacks for any purpose for extended periods of time? How durable is the material used, as I am aware that 600D polyester is a fairly cheap material in general?

I've also been considering something a little better as I want something that lasts for a little while, and have looked into TNF, but honestly I'm not so knowledgeable in this kind of stuff to begin with, so I'm open to any suggestions!

146,malefashionadvice,"Hey Guys!

This question might sound a bit weird but I was discussing this with a friend the other day...most denim or trucker jackets seem to have these loop buttons you find on most shirts. But then again I found that more jackets seem to have snaps instead of buttons lately. Almost all shearlings have snap closures now and especially Levis seems to put them on almost all of their jackets. Not sure if this is a new trend because I  found that many models from the 60ies and 70ies also have snaps instead of buttons so I'm wondering what is more classic: That type of button you find on shirts or these snap on type of button. From a practical point of view I would prefer snap buttons over normal buttons especially with sherpas because it's easier to button them up if it get's cold and then I think they look pretty cool and sort of retro but I'm not sure what would be more appropriate from fashion point of view. The difference might be trivial but I'm curious what others think about that.

I have a white collar job that requires me to wear a suit and tie every day. For dress shirts it seems like there are 2 options. 

Option 1: The dress shirt collar is crisp, well put together, has a clean/sharp looking color and It's also uncomfortable as all hell. Looks: 10/10, feels:1/10. (Brand examples: CK shirts, Indochino, Daniel Hechter, Simons, Hugo Boss, and some higher end brands like Harry Rosen, and Bugatchi) 

Option 2.  The dress shirt collar is soft(er), looks weak, can't hold a tie well, and doesn't look nearly as good as the dress shirts described above. It's also very comfortable and way nicer to wear (Brand examples: Bellisimo... that's it)

I have experimented with different fits, styles, and collar sizes (14 1/2 to 16), it's not that. 

The issue that I am trying to convey is that whenever I put on a nice dress shirt like the ones described in option 1, it is the equivilent of having sand paper wrapped around my neck for 12 hours.

I normally buy my clothes from Polo Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Brooks Brothers or J Crew. But I still get my underwear from American Eagle and had two people make comments after seeing me in them.

My girlfriend made a comment too, the first time she seen me in my underwear, we were getting ready to go to a wedding and I was changing and she said ""you are too old for American Eagle underwear."" 

That's two comments in the last few months. Am I told old to wear their underwear? I also still wear jeans from there sometimes.

235,malefashionadvice,"I’ve recently gotten into western-style wide brim hats like Stetson. I ordered one and got a bunch of flack from my friends who said it fell too closely in line with the cringey trilby fedoras that are associated with incel culture. Which leaves me wondering: is there a way to rock the western cowboy-esque look? Maybe I have to go with a much wider brim to distance myself  from the trilby-look? Maybe it’s a matter of pairing- a solid shit is a way better pair than plaid.

Or am I entirely disillusioned with the notion that these hats can be worn stylishly?

I only tried on the navy blue one, which fit great, so I also bought a black one assuming it'd fit the same. Got home and noticed the black one fit a hair snugger than the navy one. I liked the overall look and ended up keeping both. Fast forward to Christmas - I ordered another pair in the khaki color online since my size wasn't in store. I tried it on when it arrived and it fit weird. The tag said 38x32 but the waist felt like a 40 and the legs were longer and less tapered than my other pairs.

**What is a fit battle?**

A fit battle is a tournament in which entrants are paired up and submit an outfit picture for each round. Other users vote on their favorite outfit, and the winner moves on to the next round.

**Format and Schedule**

The bracket will be a single elimination bracket with 32 competitors. A single elimination bracket means that if you lose a match, you will be out of the running. We will have two days of vote-in threads, where anyone can post an outfit and the top 16 outfits by upvote count will be entered into the final 32 person bracket. The first of these threads will be on January 24th and the second will be on January 31st, both at 12pm EST (normal WAYWT time). After that, each round of the fit battle will take place on Fridays at 12pm EST, with the first day being on February 7th.

**Who can enter the fit battle?**

**What do I get if I win?**

The prize is just bragging rights and a flair on the subreddit. The real prize is the friends we made along the way.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please voice them in the comments. We would love any feedback on the fit battle and want to hear any ideas you might have.

I recently decided to dress more classy.

I bought a very nice coat, though I would like to be 100 % sure it's not a female coat.  
The reason I have some doubts is that the pockets are quite thin, plus the buttons are bright; which is, if I recall correctly, often a female clothes trait.

302,malefashionadvice,"Was wondering how people's work and leisure wardrobes interact, and how far you profession therefore impacts your style even outside of work.

I have to wear fairly boring smart-casual clothes to work, so the majority of my wardrobe is smart casual. I wear chinos more often than jeans, because I can dress them up with a button down for work, or down with a tee for casual wear. But sometimes I wish my casual style was a little more interesting. I'm torn between having a smaller minimalist capsule wardrobe where everything goes together, or a split personality with work clothes on one side, and casual wear on the other. Problem is, I spend most of the day working, so it doesn't really warrant buying extra casual clothes.

What about gym clothes? I have some branded gym clothes which a lot of people would use as streetwear, but which I only wear to the gym. Doesn anyone's casual and gym wardrobe cross-over? If anyone knows the youtuber Joe Lee he wears the same stuff all day every day, be it to work, gym, or to socialise (though I believe he does change clothes to work out in, but I mean the style is consistent between all three).

Also, I just bought a motorbike so now I need protective gear, and that is a whole new problem. So I'm wondering whether to buy protective gear that I can intergrate with my existing wardrobe, or have a seperation again.  Then I need to choose my next bike based on what goes with my protective gear. Life is a nightmare when you over think to this level...","Do you have a single style, or several?

323,malefashionadvice,"Hi,

I'm new to this reddit but I had bought an Indochino suit about a year and a half ago. I maybe wore it about 4 or 5 times on some special occasions and on one such occassion took it out to wear just today and while lint rolling it noticed a number of small holes in both the jacket and pants. I wanted to ask if others had experienced this with their indochino suits. Honestly I have no idea how these holes came about as I've never accidently run along any sharp edges of anything that would have caused it and certainly if I did I would have noticed it at the time. The only explanation I can think of is the fabric is thin/cheap which would be unfortunate if that is the cause because I otherwise loved the suit and experience with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Have other people experienced this with their suits? Is there anyway I can get this fixed. The holes aren't along any seams so I don't believe their fixable as a result but I'm certainly no tailor.

I felt some discomfort on the top of my feet below my big toe and on the outer side below my pinky toe. Length-wise, I'd say they're pretty perfect, since I can squeeze in my index finger with my feet scooted all the way to the front (I compared the length of the Achilles to my other sneakers, and the lengths are pretty much identical or the Achilles even longer). I wore them again today for about 5-6 hours when I was walking around a good amount, and they were just a little uncomfortable. When I take a step, I can feel them binding tight on the top of my feet. The uncomfortable areas from yesterday are no longer that significant, but the top of my feet are a little red and sore after taking the sneakers off. I can definitely feel that they are softening up, but am wondering if I'm expecting them to stretch out more than I should.

352,malefashionadvice,"Hi guys, after several tries with Red Wing sizing I need some advice on fit and sizing.  


I live in Europe and my EU size is 41.5, so no possibility for EE fits here.

On a Brannock device I measure US 8.5 with a D width on both feet and I have tried the following:   


Oro Legacy 875 Moc Toe in  
7,5 D: With medium thick sock. Fits very snug with minimal heel slippage, maybe half a inch heel slip. Around toes quite tight, especially on my right foot. It doesn't hurt but it feels constricted, when I wiggle my toes. Toes doesn't touch the front, but pinky toe and big toe touches sides.  
8 D: Much roomier, with lots of heel slippage, around one inch of heel slippage, quite loose heel. Width was much more comfortable, no feeling of constriction when I wiggled toes, and no tightness around my foot. Felt comfortable except the pronounced heel slippage. 

  
So I ended up buying the 875 in size 8D, and after one month or so as the boot turned softer, I realised the heel slippage did not improve. Actually the boot felt  much roomier than in the beginning. I realised the only way I could make this fit was to put in a thick insole (around 4mm) and thick wool socks. I realised the boot was too large and ended up selling it.  


Next I tried the Blacksmith in Copper Rough And Tough Leather, and tried the 8D and 7,5 D. I know this is a different shoe last, but it fit just like the 875 moc toe. 7,5 very tight in beginning and 8 very roomy with lots of slippage in heel and around the sides of heel. So this time I thought to myself, okay lets go with 7,5 and walk with it everyday to see if softens up to a comfortable fit. At the present moment I have worn the Blacksmith in 7,5D everyday for around 50 to 60 days, and while it has softened up, there is plenty of room in front of the boot, almost no heel slippage and comfortable in step there is one issue unresolved. The width around toes and in the sides is still terrible, especially on right foot, the sides of my foot feels constricted and the damn boots just feels too narrow. I am very confused by now and I have concluded the following to either  
 a) size up to 8 and wear with thick insoles or   
b) keep wearing the 7,5 for 1-2 months more in hopes of more stretch  
c) give the shoes to the cobbler to stretch the width  
d) give up on Red Wing, as I have come the conclusion that 41.5 EU or US 8.5 is a size in between Red Wing size 7.5 and 8.  The 7.5 will always be too small and the 8 too large. Red Wings size jump from 7.5 to 8 is stupidly high. If it is correct that 7.5 is 25.5 cm and the 8 is 26 cm, there is a jump of 0,5 cm which is more than 1 size!",Red wing sizing - should I give up?

 I've spent some time looking around and found that the four jackets from Lucky, Belstaff, and Massimo Dutti, linked below are close to what I'm looking for in terms of style/look. 

I have been looking at fabric type and reviews to see if the jackets would be too warm for me. I would like advice on a lightweight (or breathable if that exists) bomber jacket in the vein of the ones below, can be any brand. $50-200.

It honestly impressed me because it's so effortless, and yet looks good/suits him well. He has a good body so he appears fit with the T-shirts (I assume it's some special material that sticks to your body). And then he compliments his look with a beard and accessories like his super expensive watches. Kinda gives off a boss vibe.

What does everyone think about that? I have honestly been thinking of just buying 10 pairs of plain T-shirts, maybe every 4-6 months or until they get worn off, and just wearing them always (unless I have to go to a wedding/event or something). I found a certain brand that has some really good quality and fit, for $10 a piece, and the best part was that I notice that it gives my body a much more muscular look.

My budget is on the medium side. I'm not up to APC levels, but I shop around Nordstrom and Banana Republic level stores usually. I'm at around $100 per shirt at this point, but I try to catch things on sale.

Some brands I usually wear:

* Uniqlo
* Express
* Scotch&amp;Soda
* Banana Republic
* Abercrombie&amp;Fitch
* J. Crew

I tend to wear more casual clothes. My go-to outfit is a button-down, jeans, and some Toms or white sneakers. I've been branching out lately and trying to wear some more interesting combinations. I got some nice coats that I've been layering things under, and once it warms up, I'm gonna try some chino pants out. I like a lot of color on my shirts, and I pretty much exclusively wear slim and skinny everything. I tend to wear basic colors and have one piece that pops. I don't usually dress formally at all and I wear shirts untucked. If I had to try to categorize it, I'd probably call it something hipster-y.

What are your thoughts on some places to check out? Any suggestions would help. I'm trying to take it in chunks, which is why I'm focusing on Soho first. I don't want to have to walk all over the place and keep doubling back, so if anyone has some insight on some routes to take, I'd love to hear it.",NYC shopping on a modest budget

I purchase my clothing primarily from Amazon. Recently I purchased 3 pairs of J.M. Haggar dress pants of different colors for more formal events. 

I am now looking for good dress shirt brands/types to re-create those outfits at a fairly low price. My budget per shirt ranges from $20-$50. I have browsed the information from the top dress shirt recommendations megathread and a few individual threads but still am not 100% certain on any brand and really don't want to waste money on poorly made clothing. Some of the shirts I had in my cart and was about to buy had absolutely terrible reviews and others are pretty meh. Would like some advice from someone who actually knows their stuff before I settle on anything.

465,malefashionadvice,"Hi guys! I came out as trans not too long ago and I'm trying to expand my wardrobe to include more masculine clothing so I can eventually pass as a guy. I saw a post on the wiki about advice for trans people, but it's five years old and I figured I'd ask for more up to date advice.

I have very wide hips and a large butt, so I can't really go by waist size when shopping for jeans. Also I'm 5'1"" and petite, so length is also a concern. Any tips on how to go about shopping for pants? I'm into the slim fit silhouette but open to ideas. Because I'm small, shopping in the men's section is almost always out of the question. Right now I do most of my shopping in the boys section (which I don't mind honestly). 

In terms of tops, I don't have an issue with my chest because I bind my chest and it becomes completely flat. I do have an issue with the length/sleeves. I usually can't find very trendy/colorful clothes in the boys section. Anywhere I can start looking for more fashion-forward tops that would fit me?

Hi there, my first post here on this subreddit. I would like to receive some tips on how I should protect my latest shoes. As can clearly be seen on the left, my old shoes have not survived well through the last year (Fig 1.). Bought them back in January 2019, and I'm not sure and would like to know if this is the case, but I think it even developed mold on it (the black spots).

So now time for new shoes, I bought myself a pair of ""Killington Chukka Wheat Nubuck"" Timberlands (Fig 2.), which fit me quite nicely, but I'm clearly doing something wrong with how I care for my shoes and would like to not repeat doing it. I was recommended the water proof spray thats also in the picture, and applied 2 layers of it. But, I'm still quite scared they'll get muddy from the rain here in the Netherlands so I'm asking for some extra tips, what tips could save my shoes and make them last/ look clean for a long period? And how often should I spray a new protection layer on my shoes/ do I have to wash them first when I do that? Hope my information is usefull and you guys could give me some genuinely usefull tips.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!","Ballsed up my last shoes, would love some tips to do it right this time around."

The one I’ve found that a: seems a remarkably good price, and b: fits surprisingly well, is the [SuperDry windcheater](https://www.superdry.com/mens/jackets/details/147287/hooded-technical-pop-zip-sd-windcheater-jacket-black). Having lost 10% of myself this year, and slowly losing more/rearranging it with more acrobatics, I’m quite enjoying the more show-offy-ness of slimmer cut clothing. I also tend to find slimmer cuts more flexible for day to day stuff – no material getting in the way. And it seems that the  [SuperDry windcheater](https://www.superdry.com/mens/jackets/details/147287/hooded-technical-pop-zip-sd-windcheater-jacket-black) fits well now (a couple of years ago it was a case of just… no). I’m also an increasing fan of their stuff that doesn’t have an enormous logo on it, because you can often end up with louder colours, which I enjoy #bringOnTechnicolourFashion. 

It also seems that everyone else at the moment makes jackets that aren’t as slim cut or as cheap for not much more protection (sailing/outdoors jackets are easily 3x the price), or in styles that aren’t what I’m looking for (patch vs inset pockets, puffer jackets which seem so very primary school…)

I have two questions. 

1; Does anyone have any idea on how water-resistant this jacket actually is? I’ve heard mixed reports. 

2; Does anyone have any suggestions on a similar alternative? Everyone and their mums has had one at some point.

They are all in *size 42* and the Achilles Low Retros have an off white sole. 

I just got the Artisan Lab ones and I actually think they are the sleekest ones of the bunch and they most definitely have a stiffer leather quality. So stiff that I don't remember the other ones being that hard on my feet when they were new. Hopefully they'll soften after some more wears. Other than that I think the Artisan Labs and the regular Achilles are basically the same kind of shoe. The main difference being the difference in leather quality, a cm or so in size (although that might be because the CPs have been used a lot more?) and the heel. 

You'll have to excuse the lighting of the picture - we haven't seen the sun here in Sweden for about four months now.

They are suggesting I order a custom 42R with 40x32 Pants.  The issue in having is that this now becomes much more expensive because it's custom because they don't sell seperates for any other cuts other that slim.

Hi Everyone,

probably not the post that you are used to seeing here, but I have seen from time to time us appreciating a good pair of shoes. It is a part of our style after all.

So, with the initiative of another redditor (slayer\_mike) and some guys at r/goodyearwelt we have been organizing a **GMTO** for the boots you see in the picture.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/ejl731/gmto_interest_check_carlos_santos_field_boots_in/)

Essentially the boot is made by **Carlos Santos**, but with a **Dainite Rubber Sole** this time and a price of **315$** and **free shipping internationally**. If you are in the **EU, add +25% VAT**. It has a lead time of about **2-3 months, usually around 2**.

We have gathered enough people, but thought it might be a good idea to check if some of you might want to join! This is **goodyear welted** and **hand patinated** in **Wine Shadow color** (burgundy shades) and is very similar to Edward Green's iconic Galway in Rosewood. I call this the Salway :)

You are more than welcome to PM me here or leave a comment and I will try to reply to all of you. We will go through with this in the next couple of days.

**PS. I hope this does not break any rules, if so, please PM me and I will amend/delete. I am not sure this counts as crowdfunding (side bar rules), we just gathered 5-7 people that wanted to remake the boot posted on the sub.**

Best,

146,malefashionadvice,"As the title says. I've never really worn fragrances before, as I worked in a scent free environment for years.
Job has changed, etc, and I'm now dating a woman who absolutely adores perfumes (she has a pretty amazing collection) and colognes. I've discovered a love for them, but want to diversify the kinds of scents I have. So far I have three:

Bvlgari Man Black (not be confused with Man in Black) - she's loved this one, and finds it clean, fresh, and enticing.

Versace Eros Flame - this one was a gift from her. She finds it woodsy (especially when the base notes come out) and if she smells it on me before we go out, well...we're not going out for a while.

Armani Acqua di Gio - an older one, definitely. She's pretty blasé about this one. I had selected it based on being told it's a ""classic"".

I'd like to be able to shake it up a little. I've got a clean, fresh smelling one, and a spicier, woodsy one (probably won't wear the Armani much as it doesn't grab her). What scents could you all suggest that have a different scent profile to the Bvlgari and Versace ones, that get great reactions from the ladies?

I need a new sportcoat.  The ones I have are either too big (think something that could double as a dining fly) or too small (think Chris Farley in Tommy Boy) due to fluctuating weight over time.  I've finally settled into a steady weight and my new job has presented a need for a good sportcoat that'll match my existing work shirts whenever we have a meeting with our consultants.  I typically wear either short- or long-sleeve button-ups with khakis for the comfort of them.  The colors I'd need to match most times are light blue, purple (LSU version), and light yellow.  I've always had navy blue blazers but feel like that's...boring.  Is there another color that'd work better with what I've got?  If navy is still the way to go, so be it, but would a brown or gray work better?.  What about patterns?

I decided in late October I wanted to take the Bespoke plunge with a local tailor in Austin, Ross Bennett ([http://thetexastailor.com/](http://thetexastailor.com/)). Well the results are in and I got my suit.

I ended up getting a three piece suit with Huddersfield (English mill, owns The Rake Magazine) fabric.

The goal was to get something classic and timeless that fits.  While I love Suitsupply for example many of their stuff is too tight on my athletic build.  As far as this suit I will say that when I put this on it felt right on point to my measurements. 

You will also note the 4"" notch lapel (most RTW suits have a 3.5"" - 4"" lapel). I was frankly concerned on how it would look on me but given my proportions it actually accentuates my chest and shoulders a lot without throwing things off. 

Note the pick stitching on the lapel as well.

The suit has a light canvas between the fabric so it's lightweight. I also decided to go with light shoulder padding to accentuate what I already have naturally!   I like the waistcoat also. If I could do it all over again I'd probably make some slight changes to the waistcoat such as making it 5 buttons instead of four and changing the shape of it a bit but overall I'm satisfied with it.

The lining you'll see is a world map in royal purple.  Thanks to my girlfriend for picking it out for me!

Some notes on the details of the paints: I opted for side tabs instead of belt loops. Frankly you don't need a belt if your suit is Bespoke or MTM because it should fit perfectly on your waist.  I also got a small coin pocket on my pants as well. 2"" cuffs. I'm 6'1'' and they sit nicely on the bottom of my shoes. They also add weight to the pants to drape a bit for the pleats.

The single pleats offer me extra room in my legs and thighs though in hindsight I didn't necessarily need them since these pants fit great. They do hide any sort of stuff I put in my pockets though and they don't make the pants or the entire silhouette of the suit any less rakish.

Having done this whole process I will say at first I was excited but not without any trepidation or worry about the process.  Would I get everything spot on or would it look like a mess?  I'd certainly do it again and looking forward to making more custom pieces.",My First Bespoke Suit

173,malefashionadvice,"Hey Everybody,

Trying to buy a tuxedo on a student's budget for an event I have in a couple of months. Here are some photos from one I tried on today - it's used, and seems to be at least 10years old or so, but it is in very good condition. It's 55% Polyester, 45% wool, which I don't know how I feel about, but for the price I think it's fine.

Here are my thoughts on it :

* I think the sleeves are a bit too short and a bit too wide.
* I'd like to slim down the pants, as the side profile looks very old-fashioned to me. I'm not someone who wears sprayed on pants, but I would like them to fit a bit trimmer.
* I think the back and the sides need to be taken in. Sides because it just looks better when your chest looks like V, back because I have quite a big bottom and thus, a lot of fabric right above my back is basically just hanging from my shoulders. It does not have vents though, so I'm not sure.

I'm asking Reddit as I have never even tried a tuxedo on before, although I have many suits and I'm not sure how much the fit is supposed to be different.

Am I overthinking this or is everything ok? Don't want to fork out 500+ euros for a new tuxedo, but would like to have something decently nice that I could still wear in the future for a bit.

- All listings **must** be posted from reputable platforms like Grailed, Ebay, Depop, Poshmark, etc. 

- All transactions are to be conducted through these sites. If you go offsite, you do so at your own risk.

- **All disputes should be handled through Grailed/Ebay/Paypal.**
__________________________________

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers. 

- Ask for measurements if there aren't any. Tag sizes vary wildly. 

If you want to do a trade: 

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection.",Buy Sell Thread - January 06

200,malefashionadvice,"My friends and I are long time r/malefashion advice users and we have learned a lot on this platform. Recently we realized almost all of our shopping  has slowly became online. We think we might have a cool new approach to online shopping. 

A lot of online shopping tools (Amazon) are not catered very well to fashion and If you are shopping on fashion-centric websites (Adidas) most of the content is shown on models wearing one brand. We are trying to build a tool that presents outfits posted on reddit with all the items on the fit tagged and linked back to a site where you can buy them. Ideally this tool will create a smoother and more productive shopping experience where purchasable outfits and items are authentic and complete (not just models wearing all Nike).

This is a video of what the feed will look like. You can see how the items are tagged up. Clicking any of the items will take to an explore feed where all outfits containing that item are shown.

Explore tab visual:

https://reddit-uploaded-media.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/images%2Ft2_fnkkt%2Fi5hbq10dm5941

We have big ideas for this tool if there is any interest from you guys. We think we might even be able to use affiliate links to give our users discounts on literally everything they buy. In the the next 3 months we would love to have something build that we can put in your hands but we wanted to gauge interest first. We figured if anyone was remotely interested in shopping with this tool it would be r/malefashionadvice.

JAB was about $65 for pants, which may be alright, but I wanted to check out MW. They started picking out shirts that were $99/each.

So I’m going to try shopping again tomorrow. Where else could I check? I’m going to Corpus Christi, TX. They have a Dillard’s, Macy’s, JCP, along with JAB and MW. 

I bought a shirt at Beall’s a few years ago and it was junk. $20 for the shirt, tie, cuff links, and tie clip. The shirt seams fell apart and buttons fell off. I don’t want that.

##Streamlining asking and receiving advice

This community actively redirects short simple questions into daily recurring megathreads.  

This is so that a community of 2+ million users doesn't get overwhelmed by the sheer number of posts, and that good substantive quality content doesn't get drowned out. Instead, short questions like ""what colors go with navy?"" or ""can any identify this jacket from a picture?"" get answered quickly and doesn't clutter up the frontpage of our community. 

Don't let this scare you though! You're more than welcome to post large scale wardrobe rehabilitation posts. Of if you're seeking obscure information, or have a special circumstances that makes an answer in the megathread unlikely. For example, dealing with a medical condition or information on a particular subculture.

Finally if you've posted in the Daily Questions megathread several times and don't believe you've received a satisfactory answer, just shoot us a message and we can approve a post.

## Getting Started: The Most Basic Advice

These guides give a basic outline on dressing better and developing your own personal style. Think of it as the textbook for ""MFA 101: Introduction to Dressing Well"".

###The ""Basic Bastard""/Basic Wardrobe

This is a wardrobe created for someone who is new to the idea of dressing better. It is very simple, basic, and has relatively few items that should be available at most retailers. Note that the name of the ""Basic Bastard"" guide and wardrobe is meant to be tongue-in-cheek humour.

Looking to improve my wardrobe for when I’m in the office and also when I’m out of the office. A little background... I used to be big on streetwear and sneakers but grown out of that look. Looking to develop more of a fashionable grown look. What I wear to work now typically is jeans, sneakers, and polo. Looking to dress up a bit more than that, not because I have to but I want to. 

I know there’s the guide and sidebar but lost on how to start... I’m 6 foot 190 by the way and will continue to bulk a bit, muscular body. Only things to work with Bred 1’s and Some cheap black Chelsea boots right now I found on amazon... so essentially starting from ZERO. Donating basically all old clothing that either doesn’t fit or doesn’t transition well into the new style I want to develop.

Pieces I want to start with

- well fitting jeans that have stretch material since I’m bulking in the gym and thighs will continue to grow (navy, black, khaki)
- white Italian leather designer shoes
- jacket
- blazers 
- grey tees or neutral colors

315,malefashionadvice,"Hey fashion gurus,

I'm looking for recommendations for a high-end wool / cashmere coat for a tall slender man. This would ideally be a topcoat, could be a peacoat or overcoat. I've browsed a lot of threads and looked in a lot of stores, both physical and online (partial list below), and it's been hard to find something that checks all the right boxes. I'm hoping you dapper gents can point me in a useful direction!

Relevant info:

* I'm looking to spend &lt;= $2,000.
* I'm 6'2"", about 175 lbs. Narrow shoulders, pretty thin. I need to get measurements, but the size 40 Cucinelli pictured below fit me perfectly.
* I definitely want something that has definition to the shoulders and is slim-fit. (See pic below for an example.)
* Coat should end above the knees.
* Should primarily close via buttons. Zip is fine if it's a removable / secondary option.
* Prefer charcoal or black, solid color, no significant pattern.
* Prefer some cashmere, but not required.
* Coat should either have slanted pockets, or at least have pockets that are comfortable for resting one's hands in while the coat is closed.
* Single or double breasted doesn't really matter, but it is a plus if I can wear it with the collar up as well as down.
* I'm looking for an **elegant** coat but not a **formal** coat. My apologies for that sounding vague -- I don't really have a good vocabulary for what I mean here. The best I can say is that it shouldn't look or feel like it's skimping on anything, and it should nicely define the ideal thin man's body shape -- wider at the shoulders, slim-fit, and good straight lines when open and closed. (I want to avoid the hanging / draping look, e.g. from canvas trench coats -- and I also want to avoid coats with more curve around the hips, as that feels to me like a more feminine look.) 

I found a coat that was almost perfect at Mario's in Portland, a Brunello Cucinelli for $1850 with a lovely shape, style, and feel -- but with vertically-oriented pockets, positioned so that it doesn't feel natural to rest your hands in them when it's closed. So close and yet so far. 

I've checked with a lot of stores in the Bay Area and Portland, MrPorter, Neiman Marcus, J. Crew, Spier and Mackay ([this one](https://www.spierandmackay.com/charcoal-wool-cashmere-single-breast-overcoat.html) looked good but they don't have it in my size), Bonobos, Suit Supply ([this one](https://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/coats/dark-grey-overcoat/J726I.html?cgid=Coats&amp;prefn1=materialID&amp;prefv1=wool|cashmere) looks decent, maybe too flared in the hips), Yoox, and several others.

Any thoughts?

361,malefashionadvice,"Good morning! 

I am coming to all of you at Male Fashion Advice for advice on suits for my Wedding this coming August. I want to get out in front of this and have plenty of time to make changes as needed and despite trying to do some research online information appears to be all over the place. 

For some quick background, I live in the Chicago-land area. I have an athletic build at 6'0"" and some change, weighing about 240lbs. Broad shoulders, huge neck, large quads. Suits and nicer clothing have always been miserable for me to shop for because anything that fits my necks tends will cause the chest and waist to be immensely oversized. Any pants that fit my waist often are extremely tight in the quads and I feel like going from sitting to standing risks ripping my pants. I'm also a sweater and the wedding is in August in Michigan...mostly indoor but I'm sure pictures and stepping outside will happen so a stretchy, breathable fabric would be nice to have. 

So what my fiance and I think would be best is going the custom route and this way I would also have a suit that actually fits me for the first in my life that I can wear if needed going forward. This is where I'm looking for input. I had originally looked in to some of the custom suit companies I had heard of on the radio like Indochino or Enzo Custom but the reason I am uncertain of going to a place like this is that we want the groomsmen in the wedding to have similar style and color suits without having to force them to go get custom suits of their own. 

The other options we considered was Men's Warehouse which, from some searches I did on this subreddit, is heresy. However, it would allow my groomsmen to have very similar suits (which my fiance wants). I also was in the wedding of friend who did a custom through Men's Warehouse and he seemed to have a good experience. He does have a much more normal build than I do, though, which certainly plays into that. 

I'm definitely open to advice and have seen places like Suit Supply mentioned as a step up from Men's Warehouse or Joseph A Bank (who I have never had a good experience with). We're probably looking to spend around $1000 at the top end but knowing that I won't be wearing this suit often after the wedding means I'm leaning towards a less expensive option if possible.

370,malefashionadvice,"Hello! Long time reader, first time poster.  

To get right into it, I was born with a benign tumour in my left arm that essentially means it is twice the size of my right arm. This has made finding well-fitting shirts a nightmare. During the day I typically wear short-sleeve T-shirts which fit fine, but I could never wear a long sleeve shirt without it being painfully uncomfortable.  

This is fine for ordinary day wear, but I am about to graduate university and begin working in offices and going to formal events. Finding dress shirts has been difficult. If I can find a shirt where my arm will fit in the sleeve, the length of the shirt will essentially be a dress as well as fitting weirdly around the collar. Getting such a shirt adjusted at a tailor would have cost £50, which I cannot afford to do for every shirt.

Does MFA have any ideas for a solution that would also be inexpensive? All that I could think of would be wearing short-sleeve shirts, but do these work with suits etc? Or, is it possible to find dress shirts that are 'baggy'? Sorry if that is a silly question, I am new to formal wear!

The most expensive suit I have worn to this point is one that I got at Kohl's for about 135 dollars, so I am completely in over my head for this purchase.  Recently, I also got a sport coat tailored and am in love with the way it fits me compared to one right off of the shelf, so I am leaning towards getting a custom one right now.

A few things about me and what I am looking for:

I am a smaller/slimmer guy (5'8"" and about 140lbs) so it is difficult for me to find suits that fit my frame and especially around my arms, where shirts and coats tend to look like wing suits.

I am planning to go into sales and want a suit that will both hold up for travel and look sharp.

I would prefer to work with a reputable company like Brooks Brothers, but that is really the only one that I know off the top of my head.

I live in the Philadelphia region but go to school in North Carolina, if their are any place you would specifically recommend that I go to.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, I am so excited to see what you all come up with! Thank You!",If you had $1000 for your suit/professional wardrobe how would you spend it?

446,malefashionadvice,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21 year old British guy.

I'm looking for your take on the essentials of a classy mens wardrobe -

I work in an office 45 hours per week but don't earn a massive amount, I'm looking for some timeless classics that I can invest in over the course of a year to have a stylish and manageable interchangeable wardrobe.

I once saw a cheat sheet created by Antonio from Real Men Real Style however it seemed quite ""dated"" and the comments he received also reflected that.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you recommend? for suits, blazers, trousers, shoes, accessories.

I don't have a large budget, it would be approximately £200 per year.

My office doesn't have a strict dress code, anything is acceptable apart from Casual dress, I'm ideally looking for a mixture of formal and business casual to allow me to be more diverse depending on my plans for the day. At the moment, I own a charcoal grey suit, tweed blazer, navy blazer and I normally wear Navy Chinos and a white shirt. Shoes are normally Brown John White shoes or Dark Brown Chukka Boots.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,

&amp;#x200B;

460,malefashionadvice,"Hi guys. This community has helped me up my fashion game so much over the last year or so, so thank you. 

I work in federal consulting which requires me to dress business casual to business professional daily. The last dress pants that I bought, I bought 2 years ago for my internship. They are 34x30 and were very tight at the time. Now they literally fall straight off of me without a belt and look to be 1” too long (bunch at the ankles). I have since lost about 30lb of fat and tried some on at Jos Bank yesterday and fit pretty well in the 30W, but they felt pretty low quality. So that leaves me two questions:

1.	How much can I tailor my existing pants? They would need to be brought in at least 3” at the waist, shortened about 1”, and I’m not sure what else. 
2.	What brands/styles should I check out for some new ones? Ideally they taper at the ankle a bit since I dress modern. I have searched this sub but haven’t seen recent recommendations.

24,malefashionadvice,"I'm 16 so I'm always tight on money but ever since like a year and a half ago I've been really into differentiating myself through how I dress. Everything is just so open and there are so many possibilities but I'm having trouble narrowing down those possibilities and pinpointing how I want to dress and also building my wardrobe based off that knowledge.

I started out buying some replica pieces of clothing, until I realized that was a shitty style as I looked through more and more inspos and fashion pages. I think I formulated opinions on how I wanted to dress kind of fast, which didn't necessarily stick and I ended up buying some replicas and pieces from uniqlo or pacsun that lost their novelty pretty fast as I started further expanding my knowledge of what was out there in terms of fashion. It's not like I've been buying tacky shit like supreme box logos or heavily branded clothing, and I know I'm dressing miles better than I would have been a year ago, but the more I learn about designers, and digest more inspiration from stuff like photos, runways, or even grailed listings, the more I really want to try out different styles of fashion. Stuff like the ""slp"" aesthetic, or avante garde styles with desigers like yohji, rick, ann d, etc, all look really really cool and I want to move away from shit you could find on r/streetwear to something more unique. 

Obviously the biggest problem is money. With expensive, designer, statement pieces I feel like you have to be really careful about what you pick, and on top of that have a wardrobe that can fit around the style of whatever pieces you are purchasing for absurd prices. I guess I'm just having trouble finding a style that I want stick with, and also building a cohesive wardrobe that I will like for a while so that I'm not stuck constantly yearning for different clothes than what I currently have. 

I feel dumb writing this and really don't even know what advice can be given on this matter but I just wanted to write out my predicament anyway. thanks if you read this far and any advice or past experience would be really helpful to me",Desperately need help forming a wardrobe that will last me more than 3 months before I'm tired of it.

What i usually wear:

I am 16 and usually wear fitting clothing - mostly dark  - with some white Air Forces 1 or plain all black sneaker.I do sometimes like to play with proportions and wear a bit oversized clothing.In winter I mostly turtle necks.

Jawnz: Internet vernacular for essentially clothing

**What is No New Jawnz/No Buy/No Cop January?**

Exactly as it sounds its a self imposed limit on purchasing new clothing. This is a personnel challenge, not any sort of community mandated event.

**When is it?**

Officially it runs through January 2020. However if you do make it through the entire month I might extend the challenge to keep it going another month or just seeing how long you can go until you do purchase something. 

**What are the rules?**

As stated this is self-imposed which means you can adopt the rules that you would like to engage with. See some examples below but feel free to adjust or add based on your personnel belief
 (Taken from /u/thewardrobenerd's [FFA Low/No Buy: January - March 2020](https://old.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/efvy1f/ffa_lowno_buy_january_march_2020/) post on /r/femalefashionadvice 

&gt;* Buy nothing whatsoever.
&gt;* Reduce the *number* of items you buy (such as the [20 in 2020 challenge](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6IweobnvP-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)).
&gt;* Reduce the monthly or quarterly *amount* you spend.
&gt;* Create a list of what you will need and only purchase those items.
&gt;* Only buy from a certain type of retailer such as [not buying new](https://www.instagram.com/notbuyingnew/?hl=en) or only buying from local small businesses.
&gt;* For each item you want to buy but don’t, donate a certain percentage of money to your charity of choice or put a certain amount in a savings account.
&gt;* Do something more extreme - [only wear one outfit](https://mymodernmet.com/julia-mooney-one-outfit-100-days-project/) or [don’t shop at all](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/opinion/sunday/shopping-consumerism.html).

**Why should I participate in No Jawnz/No Cop January?**

Some potential reasons that you may be interested in are:

* Simply just saving money for future purchases
* Taking time to appreciate your current wardrobe and the clothing that you do have 
* Wearing through your closet might give you a greater understanding of gaps or holes in your wardrobe

**I want to do this, but I don’t know how to be successful.** (Again taken from /u/thewardrobenerd's [FFA Low/No Buy: January - March 2020](https://old.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/efvy1f/ffa_lowno_buy_january_march_2020/) post on /r/femalefashionadvice 

&gt;* Evaluate your current spending habits and create guidelines that are less than your current habits but still attainable. 
&gt;* Be clear in your motivation for doing this - Are you trying to save money? Trying to escape [hyperconsumerism](https://blackminimalists.net/blog/the-effects-of-hyper-consumerism)? Trying to be more creative with what you already have? 
&gt;* Unsubscribe, unfollow, and mute/hide social media accounts/emails that tempt you.
&gt;* If you do find something you want, put it on a list and reevaluate later. Sometimes saying “maybe later” rather than “not at all” is enough to satisfy the urge.
&gt;* Remember that breaking your rules once (or twice or three times) doesn’t ruin your entire no/low buy. If you buy something you weren’t planning on, it doesn’t mean you have to give up completely.

59,malefashionadvice,"I used to have no idea what to wear but gradually I started to invest some time in self care and learning about good looking clothes, fits, what to buy what not to buy all across different subreddits here. 

Initially I was blown away by many things, such as how having expensive clothes doesn't make it better, how fit matters, combination of colours, etc. 

It was a positive experience where everyone encouraged each other to start wearing what they want and how to do it properly.   

But it's 2020 and things change. I love looking good, but I'm not *that* into it that I'd judge other people hardcore and be super critical about someone. And communities especially such as /R/streetwear is somehow in the competition to look as fucking unique as possible no matter how absurd your fit looks. People need to stop criticizing fits as if they are art pieces, because it's purely subjective. 

Sure there are pretty obvious examples of shit being unoriginal and pretty bad but i have seen pretty good fits being thrashed in the comments or on the discord over the smallest of things. Not everyone is a fucking model or knows how exactly to pose and what exactly to wear. They are people who have a life and are just trying to look a little better. 

Redditors who take their hobbies a bit too seriously which results in them becoming toxic and super critical for anyone who's amateurish or from the outside is major cringe.","I love fashion, but the community in general has become really toxic."

I was curious if the dress shoes are formal enough to rock with suits, but casual enough to wear with chinos and a tucked in dress shirt with a tie. I dress business casual at work every day except 1, where we are expected to dress ""professionally"", which basically just means tuck your shirt in and wear a tie and dress shoes. 

One small limiting factor is the fact that I wear size 14 shoes.

But does anyone know if Adidas make many thing like this? I see people in the gym with clothing like this, but im usually much smaller.

182,malefashionadvice,"So, hear me out here, because I know a lot of you raised your eyebrows upon reading the title. First, let me give a bit of background about myself so you all can see where I'm coming from. I'll make it short. 

I'm a 20-year-old guy (browsing MFA for 5 years or so now) who came out as transgender and started hormones. I'm only about 4 months in, so I'm very early in my transition. Speaking purely from a pragmatic POV, I'm still a guy. My body hasn't changed all that much yet, so my proportions are still relatively the same. I'm still 5'9"" (175 cm), still built slim, still 145 lbs (65.77 kg) or so, and still have pretty average male proportions.

Obviously, I've started expanding my wardrobe recently and I've been getting a lot of my clothing the same way I normally would. I buy Uniqlo, I thrift frequently, I use all the MFA-Approved^^tm online shops if I need new items. I generally opt for a more gender-neutral style, so I've been trying on basic clothing such as button-ups, t-shirts, hoodies, etc. What I've found is that, at least for slim men, women's clothing fits a lot better than men's clothing to the point where it's noticeable to both myself and the people around me.

Let me give a more practical example: **dress shirts**. I've bought the slim-cut Uniqlo button-up, along with many other dress shirts over the years, but they've always felt off. The shoulders are a bit too wide for me, the arms are never quite the right length and width, and the vertical cut often leaves a lot of excess fabric on the sides, making tucked shirts look awkward and poofy. The cotton usually feels stiff and less breathable than I would like, leading to stiff movement and a lot of back sweat. 

I've recently switched to wearing female blouses sized up one. Nothing really feminine at all, just your standard dress shirt, only they're usually much softer than their male counterparts, are way more breathable, and are cut slimmer. The extra room that would be used for breasts just goes up a bit, making my shoulders look wider at first glance. If anything, it makes me look more masculine. Instead of having to shove extra fabric down into my pants like a 9th grader wearing his first suit, blouses are built to be form-fitting as-is, making tucking in your shirt much easier and more comfortable.

So, what does all of this mean, exactly? Well, it's kind of made me realize how much fashion is purely marketing BS and should not be taken at face value. I used to walk directly to the men's section in every single clothing store because I naturally assumed that men's clothes automatically look better on men. Now, instead of heading directly to the men's section, I find myself having much more fun by being able to look at what each piece of clothing has to offer and judging it on its own merits, rather than writing off &gt;50% of a store's stock. 

Does this mean that you need to walk into H&amp;M and put on a floral dress? Well, no, not unless you genuinely want to. What I *am* saying is that, especially if you're a slim guy who struggles to find clothes that perfectly fit, maybe take a neutral looking blouse into the dressing room and see if you like the fit more, that's all. Fashion is all about experimentation and there's no shame in putting something back on the rack if you dislike it. The store owners won't tackle you, the teenager checking you out couldn't care less, and almost nobody notices in the first place. Allowing myself to freely peruse stores without limitation, while it may be a bit awkward at first, is ultimately liberating and has helped me expand my sense of fashion by finding more unique pieces!

If you've read this far, then thank you. I don't know what I hope to gain by posting this, but I felt the urge to regardless. I'm a lot happier now and this has always been one of my favorite communities on Reddit, so I hope everyone had a safe holiday and here's to a new decade!",The Pedantry of Labels: Why Slimmer Men Should Shop in the Women's Section.

185,malefashionadvice,"I've already spent more money than I will receive in my first month just to fit in.

I had to buy just to wear to meet clients:

\- 2 suits (dark blue/dark grey) from Hugo Boss

\- 5 shirts (3 whites/light blue/grey) from Tommy Hilfiger and Hugo Boss

\- 2 shoes (black/brown) from Hugo Boss

\- 2 belts (black/brown) Hugo Boss

You probably noticed that there is no tie... This is because I don't want to look too formal to my clients.

I bought a executive case because my current bag is kind of old and it's more fit to an academic world.

And last but no least...  I bought a Hugo Boss pen as well because actually people notice if your pen is an $0.99 one in a meeting room.

So, why Hugo Boss you'd wonder... because in this line of business, the clients want to know if you mean business when you enter in a meeting room. I've never used suits before, It's kind of new to me. But I have to look trustworthy and Armani is too damn expensive.

So, I'm loving this kind of business that I'm getting into.. it's making me trying new things and in no time I'll starting to mix some clothes because I can't always buy new outfits and I hope this this sub could  lend a hand helping me mix correctly =)",I'm entering into a corporate consulting world and... it's an expensive one.

Dec 12: contacted Corter via Instagram 

Dec 13: Payment sent/ordered saddle tan bifold guaranteeing Christmas delivery, Corter specifically stating he would ship items on the following week (week of 16-21 Dec)

Dec 23: Never received shipping notification, so contacted Corter through IG asking for tracking number. He responded saying that it shipped &amp; that I would get a tracking number in the morning.

Dec 24, 25th, 26th: Contacted each day asking about tracking, zero response. He finally responded on the 27th stating there were USPS issues and offered replacement wallet to be shipped in the morning while the issue was worked out. I replied immediately stating that I would like a replacement wallet, and denied the refund.

Dec 28th: inquired again, no response.

Dec 29th: inquired again, no response.

Dec 30: Corter- “Hey there! Very sorry, we had to make you another I thought we had one ready to go It'll ship in the AM!”

Dec 31st: inquired again, asking if it ever shipped.

I hesitated creating this post, because I know he does have a large following. But the lack of customer service has been frustrating. As you can see, there have been poor response times, meanwhile he was active on IG story/even posting discount codes for more orders without fulfilling mine. Additionally, He told me that it would ship TWICE/tracking number would be sent, replacement wallet would be sent/etc. without following through. I hate to question anyone’s integrity but I doubt the wallet ever shipped to begin with, let alone was created (I called him out on never receiving a shipment notification via email). I just want people to know what kind of customer service to expect from Corter. This is disappointing. Especially since I ordered this for a Christmas present for my father in law. I will not support this company any further.

194,malefashionadvice,"Hi MFA, looking for some advice on dressier shoes. I've scoured the sub search, and although there is some relevant info, all is fairly old, with outdated links, or probably hidden from search in the quick question threads. I have an immediate need, that is also a general need. Generally:  I am getting to a point in my life (read: I'm getting older) where I want to look presentable at all times, and would like to drop gym shoes and sneakers from my wardrobe entirely (outside of specific instances like going to the gym).

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately, I am going to a trade show at the end of the month, followed by a couple of weeks of traveling, and am looking to only pack one pair of shoes. At the trade show (Outdoors industry), dress code will mainly be jeans or slacks, and some sort of dress shirt. I will not need to wear a suit. I will, however, need to look sharp. I will be doing some serious walking (last year I clocked 10-15 miles per day) and standing for 12+ hours per day.

&amp;#x200B;

Following the show, I will be in Indonesia, then Japan for a couple weeks. No suit occasions there, but still need to look presentable. Also, will be doing some light hiking (nothing too intense, this is Asian hiking, so more like strolling on trails). Also, being in Asia, would prefer something that comes off and on quickly, so probably not lace up boots.

&amp;#x200B;

Most people at the show will be wearing things like Merrils, Salomon, etc, but I really prefer something much dressier. I would love to wear my Wolverine 1000 Mile Evans, but last year they got pretty bad a couple days in. Also, not quick to put on and off, so difficult for Asia. Was looking at Timbs Bardstown Oxfords. 

&amp;#x200B;

198,malefashionadvice,"Before I begin, I’d like to let you all know i am just a teen, and I don’t know much about boots as this is my first boot. So take this with a pinch of salt if it isn’t the best. This is my first review of any kind as well. And here are [the pictures!](https://imgur.com/gallery/mhJtsO8) My dog seems to approve. I’ve made this because I myself would’ve liked to see more reviews on these boots when I was deciding to ask for these or not, so for those of you who were in my situation, I hope you like these if you buy em!

Size/intro: Hello! For Christmas, I asked for a pair of Thursday Boots, specifically a Black Matte Captain pair in size 7.5 (I wear a size 8 in Vans), but they were too big. I returned them for another Captain in size 7 in the Arizona Adobe colorway. If I were to buy these again, I’d size a whole size down to get a 7 again. I probably have an inch at most of room beyond the toe and my heel slips just a tiny bit, but I don’t tie these too tight either.

Comfort: As for comfort, these feel more bulkier than my vans old skools as expected because of the heel mainly. However, as I walk around in them, the leather seems to be getting less stiff and more flexible for when I take a step. Also, when my heel slips just a tiny bit, it feels like the back of the top part of my heel if being scratched a bit. This sensation is slowly going away during this day that I’m walking around after the unboxing. I’ll definitely be able to jog in these and walk comfortably, although the heel will make it feel a bit stance as I’m used to running in my vans.

Appearance: Overall, both boots didn’t have any flaws that stood out in terms of the leather. And, yes, they both did have 7 eyelets on each side. There were a couple scuff/scratch marks on the leather, but I don’t mind them because I’d probably get marks just like those after some time anyway. I wasn’t too happy with the Black Matte color way as I realized it didn’t fit well into my wardrobe, but I am happy with the Arizona Adobe colorway because the brown looks rich to me. I don’t have pictures of the Black Matte colorway, sorry! The shoe is creasing as I take steps but it doesn’t look bad to me.

Color: As for the color of the boots compared to the website, I’d say both color ways were darker in real life than they looked on the website, but that might be a case by case scenario. The browns seem to be much more beautiful than the black ones though.

Conclusion: I think I’ll love these boots as they’re feeling better and better just in this one day I have them and I’ll have to make some outfits soon. For the price of this entry level boot, I’d recommend it. 

If there’s something I forgot, let me know and I’ll try to answer it.",Thursday Boot Co. Captains in Arizona Adobe

I don't mind wearing them at all, but when it's snowy with say a couple or more inches of snow, in the coming months or when it's just rainy (the Blazes do soak up the rain a bit on the sides), I'd rather wear some boots or something heartier.

It looks so different from derby shoes from Allen Edmonds and the like. It feels more casual and easier to dress down than derby dress shoes. The noticeable differences that I can articulate are:

I stumbled on MFA at the beginning of the year via FMF when I looking for a new winter jacket. I went from ostensibly not caring about fashion to making it a bona fide hobby. I remember beginning a nuclear wardrobe revamp tossing out my ill fitting clothes (especially polos, I fucking hated polos due to an incident that happened but thats a digression) for skinny / slim fits from H&amp;M, F21 etc. Then came the basic bastard phase in my life when the blue OCBD, olive pants and CPs seemed like the pinnacle of fashion. The W I D E fits I saw on Waywt seemed like an uncomfortable new place when I had just gotten comfortable with my slim fits. What finally broke my misgivings were the jwa x uniqlo pants. I fell in love with the heavy taper and have been wearing it nonstop this FW. Somewhere along the way, I learnt about the basics of layering, balance, texture, details. Thats kinda where I am right now. 

I definitely feel like I have some ways to go. Color blocking sends me running for MFA guides and I still feel too intimidated to post in WAYWT threads except on Wednesdays lol. One of my plans for the next year is to explore more styles beyond the mix of minimalism / workwear that I now feel comfortable in.

So, what was your progression like? Do you have any plans for the new decade?",What was your fashion journey like in the last decade?

296,malefashionadvice,"# Why I made this

Besides providing a comedic perspective on important subjects, Hasan has to take the cake as the single most fashionable political comedy show host. I would characterize his fashion sense as minimal basics combined with sneaker head's taste in kicks. Now that he's wrapped up the fifth volume of Patriot Act, I thought it would be cool to compile a post that puts all his fits together into one place, both for inspiration and to see if maybe people can ID some of his pieces. I'll update this post with ID/links as I or other people find them.

# Volume 1

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/ULJSWVI)

**Thoughts** 

This first season saw a fantastic fashion focused episode with the Supreme episode, but overall Hasan's style seems not as put together. 

**Best fit**

In episode 2 on Saudi Arabia he wears a cream colored sweater for the first time, which is one of my favorite pieces of his, and pairs it with pinstripe pants and a clean pair of shoes I really like. 

**Worst fit**

One thing I really don't like are the plaid shirts he wears in episode 6 and episode 7, they look off the rack from Macy's. However the episode 6 look is redeemed slightly with the black Chelsea boots he wears, so episode 7 has the worst look in my opinion.

**Items**

Episode 5: [Jordan 3 Retro White Cement](https://stockx.com/jordan-3-retro-white-cement-2011)

Episode 7: [Nike Dunk CMFT](https://www.flightclub.com/dunk-cmft-university-red-black-white-805136)

# Volume 2

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/Ea3aFrz)

**Thoughts**

Similar to volume 1, Hasan's fashion is hit or miss although this volume is better that the first. This volume we saw some regular pieces which he wears regularly like the cream colored sweater from volume 1 episode 2, the white shoes with a stripe from volume 1 episode 2 as well, and the black Chelsea boots from volume 1 episode 7.

**Best fit**

My favorite this volume has to be what he wore in episode 1, simply because the silk green bomber is so dope. I'm not in love with the shoes, but that bomber carries the whole outfit. The other look I appreciate is from episode 2. The suede (or velvet) blue shirt jacket, with those chunky shoes looks really cool and put together. The whole thing works.

**Worst fit**

Nooo, not more plaid! Episode 3 he brought a plaid shirt back and it looks just awful. Burn that piece of clothing like H&amp;M burns their excess inventory.

Episode 6: [Air Jordan 1](https://www.nike.com/launch/t/air-jordan-1-black-white-sail-gym-red/)

# Volume 3

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/nouxurq)

**Thoughts**

This is the season where I think Hasan's style really finds its groove. Gone are the plaid shirts, its just pure drip for the whole volume. This is the volume where we see Hasan's taste in sneakers really come to the forefront as well.

**Best fit**

This is a hard one to choose. From a more streetwear POV I love episode 3's [green Helmut Lang taxi hoodie](https://www.helmutlang.com/taxi-hoodie/883389673511.html), cropped pants with the green stripe down the side, and the black shoes with a white stripe from volume 1 episode 1. In terms of my personal taste, I also love what he wore in episode 5. Those plaid pants are the bomb, and combined with a black crewneck sweater and the chunky sneakers from volume 2 episode 2 it all comes together into a look I would love to copy.

**Worst fit**

The worst this volume was definitely what he wore for episode 4. It's just a lot of color without very much purpose. The teal sweatshirt is already off putting, but when combined a salmon undershirt and neon green Nike's it comes together into a pretty ugly package.

**Items**

Episode 2: [Air Max 90 Triple White (maybe)](https://stockx.com/air-max-90-triple-white)

Episode 3: [Helmut Lang Taxi Hoodie](https://www.helmutlang.com/taxi-hoodie/883389673511.html)

# Volume 4

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/iNV7xq3)

**Thoughts**

This is the volume where Hasan broke his own mold a little bit. And by a little bit I mean a very little bit. In the cruise episode (4) he wore a button down tee which was a good change of pace, and the in the public transit episode (3) he rocked something closer to a running outfit. 

**Best fit**

By far my favorite look this volume was from episode 1. The floral print sweater (which I desperately want to find) paired with the off white leather shoes looked so elegant. A close second would be what he wore in episode 4. I love the subtle black on black pattern of his button down. The look comes together because of the tan pants with the navy, white, and yellow stripe down the side and clean Air Force 1s.

**Worst fit**

Although it would be easy to pick on episode 3's look I don't think that's really fair since it's closer to running gear than a real put together look. Given that, my least favorite is episode 2's look since it's kinda boring. The interesting part of the sweater, the red and white cuff, just feels uninspired, and the white Nike's that have worked well in past looks just feel boring here.

**Items**

Episode 2: [Air Force 1](https://www.nike.com/t/air-force-1-07-mens-shoe-JkTGzADv/315122-111)

Episode 5: [Nike Air Max 97 (unknown colorway)](https://www.nike.com/w/mens-air-max-97-shoes-77f38znik1zy7ok)

# Volume 5

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/0I7slGu)

**Thoughts**

This is the volume where Hasan became the best dressed political comedy host. Every episode had absolutely killer looks, and it was this volume that made me decide I had to put those post together. Additionally we got a few bonus looks since he did a lot of interviews this volume. He did interview Bernie in a plaid shirt, but given Bernie's working class support I suppose that is excusable. 

**Best fit**

Covering fast fashion, I'm sure Hasan knew he had to come out drippin, and he certainly did. Episode 3's look is so fire. That white sweater I love with the pink wool coat looks awesome. The deep red on his shoes pairs so nicely with the lighter colored pink, and the brown pants separating the two balances the look perfectly. I'm not sure if I would wear this look (especially on an everyday basis), but for the special occasion that calls for something a little more original this look delivers.

**Worst fit**

Episode 2 is definitely the worst this volume, simply because it's way too boring. A jean jacket, blue button down, and pants the color of salmonella shit? I'll pass on that one and Hasan should have too.",Inspo/Review of Hasan Minaj's Fashion on Patriot Act

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers.

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection.",Buy Sell Thread - December 30

I wear a size 13 shoe. I recently went to a shoe store to get my feet measured with a Brannock device and [this is what I found](http://imgur.com/a/uWPqCyY). It looks like I'm about a 12 C instead of being a size 13 D that I always thought. On the scale of widths, a C is considered narrow (while D is normal, E is wide, etc). 

I thought I was going crazy until I tried on all of my New Balance 990v5 shoes in varied sizes;

Size 13 have been sufficient in width but much too long.

Size 12 are almost a bit too short and MUCH too
narrow.

Size 12.5 are still too narrow but long enough.

What I'm getting at is that I believe that I'm either

-A) reading the Brannock improperly. I've heard that the common person cannot read the measurements properly, and is therefore 2 times likely to be wearing shoes that are too small 

-B) I'm overly sensitive to shoe widths. If I'm a 12 C and I can't even fit a 12.5 properly, something must be wrong?

What am I doing wrong; are my feet in fact wide? Any
suggestions? Any and all help is appreciated. Thanks!",How to properly read a brannock device? (Have I been wearing my shoes wrong?)

I'd like to get one or two pairs, one in khaki and another in a color TBD.

I also just got a pair of cowboy boots so if they worked with those as well that would be a huge plus.

So I started searching for one, and I found that the company Gloverall pretty much dominates the whole market. I've been looking at their website, and also obsessively reading up on everything I can find on duffle coats.

These are the first pair of shoes I have ever worn that have fit like a glove, and it's inspired me to get all of my favorite looks in the correct fit rather than going with the beauty is pain approach I had been taking to my shoes for years.

Even the 4 interior pockets for key fobs and insurance cards/PBA cards.

I'm 190lbs (86kg) at just under 6'1 (184cm) with a 40 inch chest and 32 inch waist.  Why  does everything sized medium in the vast majority of brands  completely swamp me? I'm wearing small t shirts and oxford shirts stilll. With most brands this is meant for a 36-38 inch chest.

Usually the shoulder seams of my shirts and t shirts are an inch or two narrower than they should be, rather than being actually on my shoulder points, because I'm relatively broad - but other than that small is usually fine.

Is vanity sizing really that bad? 

I  lift weights regularly but I'm by no means ripped, just slightly more fit than most. I'm wearing a oxford shirt right now and it's still quite  baggy around the waist and if I tuck it in a load of extra fabric  gathers at the back and puffs out. If it is just British brands vanity sizing please let me know, or is it something on my end?  Should I size up to a medium for the sake of my shoulders and still buying slim/skinny fit shirts? I want to avoid muscle fit because I hate that look.

387,malefashionadvice,"Hi friends. As we’re approaching the start of a new decade, I’m starting to reassess my current clothing style and situation. Over the past decade (and more) we’ve seen the transition from classic menswear to streetwear and smart casual for the general public in metropolitan areas (NYC, LA, London, etc). In addition, we’ve seen a similar shift from classic leather strap watches (traditional Pateks, etc.) to stainless steel sports watches (Rolex, nautilus, etc) to better fit the more casual transition in clothing. I’m wondering where folks think we’re heading in the future? I used to think perhaps we’d have a transition back to classic menswear but this doesn’t seem to be the case. Everything is becoming more casual and more practical. Fewer people are working traditional jobs, in traditional offices, requiring traditional clothing and accessories. I just don’t see how that reverses back to where we started. As we head into the new year, I’m now questioning whether it makes sense to continue investing in high-end trousers, proper fitting dress shirts, etc. as this may be the look of a dinosaur of the past (apart from a few special occasions).

About 6 months ago, my parents bought me a Schott Perfecto I had been eyeing on TheRealReal for my birthday. It was a perfect jacket: super thick and soft black steer hide, in near brand new condition, and for a steal of a price! The only problem was that it was a little too big for me. Rather than do the sensible thing and return it, I kept it thinking I could make it work in an oversized kind of way. While I've had some success [layering it](http://imgur.com/a/dBme3Wk) to take up space, I haven't been able to wear it daily as it's too boxy with just a tee and jeans. So again, rather than do the sensible thing and try and recoup my loss on Grailed, I decided to wash the jacket in the hopes of shrinking it!

I did my research and found [several](http://helloblackbird.blogspot.com/2009/07/washing-your-leather-jacket-by-peter.html?m=) [sources](http://www.stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showthread.php?12109-I-WASHED-MY-CCP-FENCING-LEATHER-DO-NOT-TRY-THIS-AT-HOME-) [with info](http://www.stylezeitgeist.com/forums/showthread.php?11700-Machine-washing-and-drying-a-leather-jacket) on washing leather jackets, but mostly based my experiment off a post written here by u/eqqy some time ago. Feeling confident I could achieve some sort of result, I gave it a try. 

* 1: First, I thoroughly conditioned the jacket with Lexol and let it sit for several hours to avoid drying the jacket out during the wash.
* 2: I filled my bathtub with warm water, enough to submerge the whole jacket. Let it soak for about 20-30 mins, occasionally turning it over and gently working the leather. The hotter the water the more shrinkage. 
* 3: Then came the drying. I drained the water and then squeezed all the excess out of the jacket before sticking it in my dryer with some old towels. I used high heat for 70 mins, taking it out every 10 mins to check on the fit and to tug on the zippers. 
* 4: Once the jacket had achieved the level of shrinkage I wanted I removed it from the dryer and hung it up to air dry. This should help it drape a little more naturally. Occasionally I'd go and ""re-shape"" the jacket to get the drape right and remove any bulges. 
* 5: After letting it dry overnight, I applied some more Lexol to restore the leather. 

**Results**

[Before and After](http://imgur.com/a/dz1ji87) 

The wash was a success in my book! The whole jacket shrank down about a whole size, and has a cool texture now thanks to the washing. So far the only issue I have is that the shoulder gussets are a bit stiff, so they flare out a bit when I wear it. I'm hoping this dissipates with wear and conditioning. The leather seems to have held up alright too. No signs of cracking/blistering or any damage to the color. 

**Afterthoughts**

I'm very happy with how my jacket turned out! It was relatively easy, and the results were exactly what I was hoping for. That being said, if anyone else wants to follow this guide, I'll echo what others have said in the resources I linked, and what I learned doing this. 

* Effect on Zippers/Lining: Assuming your jacket shrinks, the zippers and lining of your jacket won't shrink with it. The zippers will have a wavy look as they pull against the leather. The lining will similarly sag, which isn't a huge issue unless you shrink too much, in which case the lining may show when you wear the jacket. A tailor should be able to fix that though.

* Effect on Leather: The leather will take on a much duller sheen after the washing, and may feel a bit more dry. Conditioning before and after should help prevent this. In addition, the grain of your jacket may become more pronounced. All this varies of course with the leather type, what kind of treatments it's undergone beforehand, and variables during the wash like water/dryer temperature and time. 

* Fit: Aside form the zippers and lining, the jacket will shrink EVERYWHERE. I wouldn't recommend this if your jacket is just big in one area, for instance if the sleeves are too long (my jacket seemed to experience the most shrinkage in the torso). In that case I'd say take it to a good leather alterations shop or try and find one that fits better. I'd say this only works if you're looking to shrink the jacket allover and if it's already fairly close to your size.","Honey, I Shrunk the Schott"

38,malefashionadvice,"As we roll in to the new year, I thought it would be nice to have a post about brands to watch in 2020.  Most of these labels you have probably heard of, and several have been around for quite a few years.  For one reason or another, I expect that their popularity will increase significantly in 2020.  Here are a few of my picks.  Please share your own in the comments below:

**1. Bode**- Emily Bode's eponymous label took flight several years ago but really hit its stride in 2019.  Her penchant for creative, intensely personal (and sometimes fully customizable pieces) has resonated with fans like A$AP Ferg, who calls it an ""American Visvim.""  Over 75 stores now stock the brand, and Emily herself was recently named GQ's 2019 Designer of the Year.

**2. Kaptain Sunshine**- Though there is already a crowded landscape of Japanese workwear/field/repro brands, Kaptain Sunshine excels among its competition.  Most of the pieces offered come in neutral tones and standard cuts with interesting details, but the fabrics transcend standard, however.  Just see the staple [Traveller Coat](https://www.namu-shop.com/collections/kaptain-sunshine/products/kaptain-sunshine-traveller-coat-khaki-brown), constructed from Super 140s Melton Wool.  The label was also recently dubbed by StyleForum voters as the best up-and-coming brand, despite having been around since 2013.

**3.  Marine Serre** - Serre launched her first line in SS19 after tenures at big houses like Dior and Balenciaga.  Serre sought to be a professional tennis player but abandoned that direction in favor of fashion.  Her resulting menswear work is heavily influenced by modern and vintage sportswear.  If you're in need of a tie-dye silk sweatsuit, look no further.

**4.  Jacquemus** - Simon Porte Jacquemus is one of the rare self-taught designers whose vision actually makes sense.  The label has transitioned in an oddball mixture of relaxed French tailoring, pocket-laden workwear, and funky, retro pieces.",Brands to Watch in 2020

I’m looking to get something that fits a little more straight/classic looking and a little less GQ/David Beckham but I’m having a bit of a hard time gathering the right reference photos.

62,malefashionadvice,"Hello guys 


I'm looking for a sneaker (not necessarily any specific model) that would go with my style. Since I don't know anything about fashion or the newer trends

Little about myself, I'm 25 with a lean athletic built and 6 feet in height. I like dressing simply and comfortably.

I only wear straight fit jeans of colours mid wash and black with plain crew neck t-shirts of colours grey, navy blue and black only paired with a minimalist digital watch (both in everyday and special occasions except when it requires a suit). 
This is the only thing that i like and I've been wearing it since 10 and I'm sorry if it's annoying.


So up until now I've been wearing asics running shoes with it. But recently a female co-worker of mine pointed out that it's basically a sin to wear running shoes with casual outfit and it kinda ruins the whole look. I didn't quite understand what she meant by that, so i thought maybe getting advice from you guys would be perfect.

If it's actually that bad to wear those shoes then what other sneakers would you recommend to me that would go with my style, I'd prefer something comfortable and practical with slightly (but not definitely) on the athletic side cause it's more comfortable and something that wouldn't catch an eye.


I'm totally a noob in the matters of style and just a low maintenance guy, so I would love to have suggestions from you experts.

After looking over all my clothes, I’ve decided on a suede jacket, preferably something like these two from ASOS since they have my size (XXS). I am a teen so I don’t think it would be too odd for me to be seen in this on a night out or in school (even though the standard in my HS for outerwear is just a hoodie).

Throughout this holiday season, my girlfriend has been trying real hard to find me a nice top coat but we’ve returned a total of 3 (we live in a rural city with no quality stores) top coats from Ralph Lauren, J Crew and Abercrombie. I’m 5’9, 130 lbs. I’m freakishly skinny with a torso I’ve gotten 36S, 34S, and a XS; but none of the coat fits how I’ve seen photos of model wear them fit. My XS Abercrombie one fits the “best”. It’s just above my knees but the lower chest and downwards, it’s awfully big. I went to an outlet mall 2 hours away today but found no top coats that looked “proper”. What should I be looking for?",How are top coats suppose to fit?
89,malefashionadvice,"Link: [https://www.brooksbrothers.com/Golden-Fleece%C2%AE-Supersoft-Topcoat/ML00474,default,pd.html?dwvar\_ML00474\_Color=NAVY&amp;contentpos=5&amp;cgid=Mens\_sale\_category](https://www.brooksbrothers.com/Golden-Fleece%C2%AE-Supersoft-Topcoat/ML00474,default,pd.html?dwvar_ML00474_Color=NAVY&amp;contentpos=5&amp;cgid=Mens_sale_category)

Price: $650 USD (I paid \~$1000 CAD after taxes in Canada) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Design and fit:**

This coat is single breasted, peak lapel, single vented, with three buttons. 

The fit is similar to the Brooks Brothers Regent fit. I’m a size 40 with a regent fit suit (I wear size 42 with Canali and Hugo Boss), and I bought a size 40 for this coat. There’s a little bit of room in the shoulders, and I can squeeze in a suit underneath. However, if you would like to regularly wear it with a suit, you probably want to size up 1 size.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Materials and construction:**

The Brooks Brothers website calls this coat a navy, “super soft” coat. When I first saw it in person, I nearly laughed at how inaccurate it is. Close up, under brighter light, the coat is nearly a royal blue. The material is also very, very rough looking if you look closely. It doesn’t seem “navy super soft” at first glance. 

In slightly less harsh lighting however, the color does appear significantly darker. In day to day wear, this coat looks just a hair lighter than navy. The material is also shockingly soft and comfortable. I would actually say it is one of, if not the single most comfortable overcoat I’ve worn in a long time. The texture isn’t smooth, but it is ridiculously soft. The construction is fine, and even going over it closely, I cannot find any flaws. The interior is unlined (only the sleeves are lined)

Interior shot: [https://i.imgur.com/JwnKnfm.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/JwnKnfm.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**What is this coat like to live with?**

The coat is quite heavy, and very, very warm. However, due to its non-lined design, the coat is quite breathable. I can wear this coat all day indoors without really breaking a sweat.  This coat is so soft, it feels like I’m wearing a Snuggie. The pockets are very big and usable (easily fits a bottle of water and a phone). Due to its softness and flexibility, I can comfortably wear this coat sitting down.

For instance, here’s my lazy boxing day outfit. I didn’t overheat with this coat on all day in a busy mall:

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion and Value:**

Brooks Brothers has created a very unique coat in my opinion. This coat is quite different than most top coats on the market, and I haven't really been able to find a similar point at a similar price point. 

Would I recommend this coat? I think it is a fantastic choice, and although the price is a bit high, I think it is reasonable for a coat of this quality. Brooks Brothers allows you to order the coat in store with no obligation to buy, so if you’re looking for a new topcoat, why don’t you give this one a shot?",Review: Brooks Brothers Golden Fleece Supersoft Topcoat

119,malefashionadvice,"Hi Friends, 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a man who is in my early 30's, skinny, beardy, shaved head (and balding; it looks great short, but I can't grow it out) and not very muscled (although I think my frame makes me look slightly more athletic than I am). I'll start by saying that I am bisexual and find androgyny in both men and women very sexy. I've been on a quest lately to discover my own 'sexy' style to give me some more pep in my step, and I'm having some trouble! I have facial hair, you see, and I really, really like it. All in all, I look a bit gruff in the face. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm looking for is some advice on how to balance androgyny with my otherwise masculine facial features. I have seen others who have done it, and to be quite honest, the common element in those I have seen is that they are all VERY attractive men who could likely pull off almost anything. While I think I'm a pretty damn sexy man myself, I'm still very much a normal looking person.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has some advice on how I, a somewhat masculine middle-aged man with a beard, can achieve that androgynous look I'm interested in, I would be very, very grateful!",Androgyny in Manly Men
120,malefashionadvice,"That's one issue that's been preoccupying me for a while. I see this as a complex issue because it a) depends very much on fit with personal style, age, etc, and b) it's about discovering the different perspectives on it. Not only that, I would find it really interesting to see where different cultural perspectives differ (I'm sure different types of bags would evoke different stereotypes in the US compared to Central Europe).


So what do MFA people use to... well... carry stuff around? I mean posing in your suit from Savile Row and Edward Green boots is all fine until you realize you gotta carry a backpack for all your stuff to fit. Perhaps I'm too middle-class to realise that I shouldn't need to carry stuff around (because that's what your Jaguar's trunk is for, duh).


But really, what are some good, stylish and/or elegant options to carry a daily amount of stuff that doesn't quite fit in pockets, but doesn't warrant a full weekender bag or so? 



So far I've observed:

- stuffing everything into your pockets. Admittedly guilty of that myself in winter, but then winter jackets are large enough not to bulge from that. Doesn't really work for temperatures over 5C due to lighter clothes.

- the backpack, or the local down-to-earth dad's choice. Whether bankers or engineers, a massive amount of people over 40 seems to carry one, and it's just... sigh. A backpack.

- messenger bags: depending on the make, either the ""I don't care"" student's option, or the young professional who doesn't want to succumb to age and to the temptation of the backpack. I am forced to use those as I haven't found anything better, but they're actually not that comfortable.

- classic briefcase: not to mention the old stuff one, even the more modern briefcases got very rare here, found only in the hands of much older, conservatively dressed gentlemen, or very pretentious young ones. I personally find most of them both too stiff and impractical.

- the small over-the-shoulder messenger/purse: or the Eastern European option, best paired with black leather sandals and socks (I'm allowed to freely make fun of that due to my own origins). If I'm completely honest, from the point of view of size and carrying capacity, it is the best option (enough space for a thick wallet, notepad, tablet, and a charger or something). But: it doesn't look great and it actually destroys some fabrics due to friction.


And then there are of course the other things like fanny packs... yeah...


I'm wondering if there are any other options? Something that really bridges the gulf between looking good and being practical?


I guess really smart backpacks could be good for some cases? They work decently well for women, but I personally really hate any kind of backpack with any kind of dressy clothes. It's like there has to be a Peak Design type of 'breakthrough' with dressy variants. Or maybe there would be a hybrid option, like a soft leather briefcase with shoulder belt...",What is the modern (well-dressed) men's solution for carrying stuff daily?

On Dec 17 I went into a Bonobos store near my office to place an order for 2 daily grind shirts, as well as a blazer. About a half hour later I checked my email for my order confirmation and realized that the guide placed an order for 2 jet setters, so I immediately called to correct the order. He cancelled the order for the jet setters (which I received a refund for) and placed an order for the daily grinds instead. 

2 days later I received the shipment for the jet setters, and then the following Monday I received the daily grinds. I received a cancellation email for the jet setters and never got a shipping/tracking email, so I am wondering if I will at some point be charged again for the jet setters unless I send them back.

157,malefashionadvice,"Hi all,  


Shot question, where's a good place to buy good fitting and quality Chelsea Boots?  


I love Chelsea Boots. They look good, they're stylish and they're versatile. The only issue is it's tough to find ones that fit the way I like.   


I'm tall and lean (195 cm / 72kg or 6'5"" / 155 lb) and like my Chelsea Boots to be less the big and chunky type and more the form foot and ankle fitting kind. Think The Beatles. The issue is that I'm generally a size 10 (UK/US) or 44 (EUR) so any time I find one that fits my foot nice, they need to be too wide at the ankle so they look a bit awkward / clunky and my trousers don't quite hang over them well.   


I normally wear the Brando, a Kurt Geiger Chelsea Boot. From a fit perspective they actually fit really well  \[Link here\]( [https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/cat/kg-kurt-geiger-brando-chelsea-boots\_690-10004-4251400109/](https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/cat/kg-kurt-geiger-brando-chelsea-boots_690-10004-4251400109/) ) 

The issue is that the quality isn't that great. I tend to have to replace them after about 6 months, even with regular polishing (leather cracks, fades, etc.) or buying a couple pairs and alternating. I can keep doing so, but what I'd really like to do is find a pair a good pair of boots that I can hold onto for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

164,malefashionadvice,"This won't be a technical review, there's a lot of information on these products that I can't find out, such as the down fill power, etc. It's just going to be based on my own experiences

[Abercrombie Parka left, Uniqlo Parka right](https://i.imgur.com/7DWOwAX.jpg)

These two Parka's not only have a similar name, but come at the same price range too, around $100-200. With the year end sales coming soon, I believe in the US the Abercrombie parka can be as low as $125.  the Uniqlo should come around the same price range

**FEEL**

The exterior of the Uniqlo feels like the typical polyester/nylon style down coat with a matte finish

the Abercrombie on the other hand feels more cotton like and less synthetic.

**WARMTH**

I also have a North Face DefDown Parka, and in the past the North Face McMurdo and Gotham.  I would say these two are not as warm, but pretty close.  You can probably mitigate this with a layer of heattech undershirts and save money, as the North Face can cost twice or thrice as much as these budget parkas

**WEIGHT**

The Uniqlo is definitely lighter, while the Abercrombie is noticeably heavier.  In fact it feels heavier than the North Face

**HOOD**

Both use faux fur hoods and both are detachable.  The Uniqlo uses snap buttons, while the Abercrombie uses buttons that are hidden under a polyester layer.  The Abercrombie hood is fully lined with faux shearling making the hood warmer. the Abercrombie 'fur' is also fluffier.

One thing to notice is that the collars are very different.  On the Abercrombie, the hood and collar are separate pieces, so the collar (which is quite high and also shearling lined) can be zipped up to your chin while the hood stays down.  The Uniqlo collar and hood are one piece (they are also unlined). Thus the way the hood rests differs.  the Uniqlo one rests behind your head while the Abercrombie one rests closer to your shoulder.

[Abercrombie left, Uniqlo right](https://i.imgur.com/runxsbN.jpg?1)

**WIND AND WATER**

The Abercrombie is advertised as water resistant and windproof. the Uniqlo is advertised as water repelling and wind proof.  Unfortunately during the time I had them, I could not test them in rainy conditions.  The Abercrombie however handles wind better. This is because the front zipper has a cover flap, while it has a ton of draw strings all around the hood and body to create a better seal

**ZIPPER**

The Abercrombie uses a double zipper system for the front, which is then covered by an overlapping flap that uses buttons and is lined with corduroy.   The Uniqlo uses a single zipper that has rubber like coating to reduce wind entry. Both are not without its flaws, getting the Abercrombie zip end into both zippers is a pain in the arse.  While the Uniqlo Zipper sometimes gets caught in the black rubber parts.  Ultimately the Abercrombie one, as said earlier, feels more windproof because of the extra flap as well as giving you options for zip or button use

**POCKETS**

the Uniqlo has two hand warmers on the chest, two large pockets, and an internal pocket.

the Abercrombie has FOUR hand warmers, two on the chest, and two behind the two large pockets!  it also has an internal pocket

The Uniqlo pockets are held together with one button, while the Abercrombie has two buttons for each pocket while the internal pocket uses a zipper.

[Abercrombie pockets etc (sorry the top left is the Uniqlo, added it by accident)](https://i.imgur.com/QNImCmB.jpg)

[Uniqlo pockets (note that it uses a single button closure)](https://i.imgur.com/0JAJiIJ.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**LEAKAGE**

all down coats and jackets leak but unfortunately I noticed the Abercrombie seems a bit more leaky than the Uniqlo

**VERDICT**

Both are probably the best budget parka in the $100-200 range you can get imho.

But between the two I would choose the Abercrombie simply because it has more handwarmers and a nice cozy faux shearling lined collar and hood.  In fact these little details made me choose it over the North Face too.  Unfortunately the Zippers do get annoying as well as concerns over the leakage. 

The Uniqlo is noticeably lighter, so if that's a concern, go for the Uniqlo. I believe all of the Abercrombie additions such as the shearling, more buttons, sturdier zippers, etc add to the overall weight.",Battle of the Budget Parkas: Review of Abercrombie and Fitch's ULTRA PARKA vs Uniqlo's HYBRID ULTRA DOWN PARKA

The specs on all the shoes seem to be the same: Margom soles, leather upper/lining.

However, considering you can get Full Grain leather uppers from many alternative brands (Koio, Greats), the ""regular"" Achilles Low seems like a scam.

204,malefashionadvice,"For the majority of my life, I have been dressing in what I understand would fit generally under an MFA uniform or similar. My typical wear is a grey/black hoodie, black or dark blue jeans and casual sneakers - Adidas Gazelle Navy etc. (not dad sneakers, or modern white sneakers).

I consider the style to be very boring and very conservative (stems from lack of confidence in earlier years). If I have to classify it, it would fit under streetwear (i.e. casual) but at the very, very conservative end.

At heart, I have always enjoyed the preppy look - nice and thick cardigans, polo shirts, chinos, trousers, ties, formal shirts, formal-ish shoes etc. On the more casual end perhaps sweatpants with a t-shirt and some type of top garment (not a hoodie for sure). [Example.](https://www.fromthemovie.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Nike-Cortez-Shoes-Wolf-Wallstreet.jpg) [Example 2.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f7/af/9e/f7af9e0b6436180aa4b8f11c5a3b82e4.jpg) [Example 3.](https://cf.ltkcdn.net/mens-fashion/images/std/217444-674x450-man-in-tucked-in-polo-shirt.jpg) I do enjoy wearing the odd button-down shirt, tucked in or with a jumper, still with the same shoes. I have been, however,  told that I look like a 'dad' and that was when I was only wearing a jumper with a shirt showing the collar. 

It certainly doesn't seem to be appealing to people my age - the majority of them wearing what I would classify as midlevel streetwear - slim-fitting white t-shirt, jumper on top (if worn), slim blue jeans or sweatpants and white sneakers. [Example.](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/6f/44/28/6f4428aaae89142e0dbf8890bfab9b53--mens-fashion-blog-fashion-blogs.jpg) [Example 2.](https://static.zara.net/photos///2020/V/0/2/p/4087/401/800/2/w/392/4087401800_2_1_1.jpg?ts=1574680937324) The other part probably being pushed to higher-level streetwear - dad sneakers, branded jumpers, majority of sweatpants. I'm in the UK. 

Now regarding my own views, I can't say that I feel like I would fit in any of the previously described looks. I would never wear sweatpants in public - I have been taught that way and in my eyes, it is just sloppy. I cannot wear skinny clothing - I am on the larger side. I am not a fan of white sneakers either - they seem almost too trendy for me. I like being a little bit different and internationally not trendy but currently, that is in a boring way. Being preppy makes me stand out too much and I fell like I am simply too young for it. I imagine myself fitting perfectly once I am 30 but at 20 it just looks a tad off. Trying to fit in modern trends would be my best bet I guess but it is just not 'me'.

My wardrobe is getting smaller and smaller to the point in which currently I wear a grey zip hoodie, t-shirt (non-visible), black jeans (large legs) and the blue gazelles 6 of 7 days a week - no exaggeration. At this point I would ask you what to buy to start changing my style - the problem is that I don't know what style to transition into. If I was to think in a vacuum I'd say that is preppy which would require a very slow transition as the change is big. 

I want to buy some new pieces of clothing but not sure what? Also, what would be your advice on how/if I should change/improve my current 'style'?

They did a mistake with the address. The Hockerty agent who wrote me admitted his mistake and told me he would make a new order for me... and then silence 
So yes, maybe I should wait and they would send me what they have to send me... but in that case  when a company makes such a mistake leading such a delay, at least the company could be responsive and let me know what s going on
I dont understand why:
The company doesn't contact UPS in the way to modify the address of the parcel which was sent to a wrong address 
I dont understand why NO ONE ANSWERS
I dont understand why I didnt get the clothes I paid for

270,malefashionadvice," Hi Guys,

Long time lurker on this page. Just a little bit about me, I'm a sneaker freaker (jordans/nike/adidas) and now slowly I'm changing my style in clothing to settle for things less streetwear but more 'gentlemen'-ish. I own 3 other pairs of white sneakers (Common Project, Greats, Axel Arigato and Adidas Stan Smith) and I will be slight comparing them. With a word of warning, I did decide to write this review due to my experience with them and I hope you guys get something out of this.

Anyway, this is my review for the Oliver Cabell Low 1. Here we go!

\----------------------

**Ease of Purchase 4/5)**  
Very easy, quick as well. Online purchase from their website, filled in the form, they accept PAYPAL and Credit Card. Got my purchase confirmation instantly and also my Shipping Confirmation in a few day (it went to my Junk Mail).

**Delivery (4/5)**  
As I'm located in Australia, it usually takes a week to have anything delivered from overseas, safe to say that the courier did it's job and that the item took slightly longer than a week but its all ok.

**Packaging (5/5)**  
Looks very premium at first, with a double box and comes with a shoe bag, which is perfect for travels and you want to bring these shoe a long. Helps prevents scratching and have to say, it was a nice touch.  
**Customer Service (2/5)**  
I've written to them twice, once about my shipping but I did not get a response. Another I wrote to them about an issue with my shoe (later to be covered) and they have responded within a day's time (props to that) but their response was the definition of terrible, as they tried to use a poor excuse to deflect responsibility.

\--------------------------

Now here come the main part, the shoe review:

**Material (3.5/5)**  
Advertised as Italian Calfskin Leather, you can say it is what it is as you take it out of the box. It looks nice there wasn't much I can comment as it seems like the leather is nice but given the fact that these are $240AUD (Roughly), I do think the price would have to stand up for the quality. The leather had multiple indents which I'm unsure as to how it got there in the first place, as you can see on the pictures it is very inconsistent but that being said, this wasn't too big of a issue because it feels like you're paying what you're getting (although it is extremely disappointing - not even my other shoes has this issue). The leather is grainy in certain parts (pictures in Style) and you can see that consistently around the ""flat surface"" part of the shoe.

Comparing to Adidas (Stan Smith), it has a familiar tone but definitely softer and not smell like shoe glue.

Comparing to Axel Arigato, for some reasons the pair I got had a really rough leather and much stiffer than the OB.

Comparing to Greats, the leather is harder but the look and texture is much better than the OB.

Comparing to Common Project, CP has a much softer feel and definitely smoother overall - truly gold standards.

As I'm no leather connoisseur, I can only judge these with my experience with leather.

**Comfort/Fit (4.5/5)**  
As soon as I stepped in it felt like I was good to go and the cushion seems to be just right for a low riding minimalist sneaker like this. I wouldn't say or guess you'll need much break in time but definitely might be different for everyone. I wouldnt say it would be the same as the CP but my ranking would be (CP &gt; OB &gt; Greats &gt; Stan Smith &gt; AA).  
The shoes runs small, order half a size down is my recommendation if you have wide feel (which is what I have) and the fit perfectly. I've tried lacing it in two ways and both ways are approachable if one is preferred to the other. Definitely have enough space but at the same time not enough for your feet to wobble inside as you walk, it felt great for me and I have no issues, IF my shoe was perfect which will be explained later.

**Craftmenship (1/5)**  
Now this is the area the shoe was a complete let down. As I stated that the leather had multiple indents and there were a slight scratch in the front. But what I noticed was the lacing on my Left pair is not constructed right down the middle like my Right pair. The leather cuts are completely uneven on my Left pair which lead to slightly shifted lacing and it did create a bit of a really strange pressure on top of my left foot when i walk in it. I must say this was very disappointing as not even Nike would release these shoes on a production line due to severe defect on this pair. This was terrible with the quality control and honestly even if everything else is imperfect, you should not get this part of the shoe wrong. My ranking CP &gt; Greats &gt; AA &gt; Stan Smith &gt; Shoes from Target &gt; OB.

**Style (5/5)**  
I love the low and minimalist design. The branding is very subtle and nothing on the side of the shoe, the white is perfect and the low riding just meets the cuff by my ankles. The design is indeed very similar to CP and it does feel like it is trying to replicate itself but at the same time paying respect the gold standard, like a little brother to the CP. The outsole is just right for people who prefer it being lower to the ground as it would be similar to a pair of Converse height but not as high as Stan Smith and Greats.

[https://imgur.com/a/imiggQA](https://imgur.com/a/imiggQA)  
\-------------------------

**Overall (2/5)**  
I wish I can love it, but when they messed up the most important pair of the shoe, it is something which can turn anything gold to a pile of brown manure. I wouldn't say they are worth the price as Greats are round the corner but sadly there design is not the same, but possible go for New Republic (I do not own a pair but my friend likes his) if you want a similar design.  
For me, it was enough for me from this one transaction to safe to say that it would be a 'No' if I would ever go back to them until they step it up with their Quality Control (which seems certain for one thing now). The price just did not justify the overall experience to me, at all.

To conclude, they have potential if you got yourself a non-defected pair - so it truly feels like a lucky dip (and from the reviews, your chances are low) and Customer Services does not care after they take your money.

\-----------------------

P.S. This was there response from the Craftmenship defect:  
""Thanks for reaching out. This is due to the fact that the shoes are hand lasted. In order to ensure that the fit is perfect the leather is stretched around a last. Leather has different elasticity based on the part of the skin or the skin entirely, given that it's from a natural animal. This will cause variations in this ""gap"" to ensure there is a proper fit. I hope this makes sense. Let me know if I can be of any further help!""

I've messaged them back explaining this seems more like a manufacturing issue not a 'leather stretch issue' but haven't heard back from them ever since. I don't want to be rude but I really hope they don't treat everyone like if they don't know anything, its pretty obvious when you cut the leather incorrectly by centimeters. Leather does not stretch by centimeters like that... or at least advise for me to ship them back to review it. \*sigh",Oliver Cabell - Low 1 - Sneaker Review (Comparisons)

&amp;#x200B;

I've just recently got a new job in a traditional industry. This company has come out with new uniforms and seem to be paving the way to become more fashionable (slim ties, navy suit, brown shoes etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Uniform: Navy pants, navy blazer, (optional dark brown leather jacket), brown dress shoots and belt/boots OR black dress shoes and belt or boots, white dress shirt.

My questions are;

* What are your opinions on classic professional vs. fashionable/trendy with black or brown shoes?
* If I chose black shoes and belt, would that clash with the dark brown leather jacket (blue tie and white shirt)
* Do brown shoes and navy suit scream trendy? Or can it pass as professional in a traditional industry?

I can easily just have a tailor stitch something over a little of the inner lining, but that would be very permanent and would hurt resale later down the line if necessary (though I do consider this an investment piece, but you never know).

Thanks to some free time around the holidays, I’ve finally gotten around to writing a guide on my favorite footwear – the moccasin. Mocs are wonderful pieces of American heritage footwear that easily assimilate with some of the other commonly recommended pieces here on /r/mfa while still adding some flair to your outfit. Hopefully this can be a useful resource for beginners looking to branch out into a different style of casual footwear since Mocs are a nice alternative to plain sneakers or chukkas.

**A History Lesson**

“Moccasin” in English is a blanket term for the footwear of choice for indigenous groups in North America. Often fashioned from deerskin or other soft leathers and featuring a distinctive U-shaped toe stitching, the styling details of various moccasins were a reflection of the lifestyles of the tribes who wore them (soft soles for tribes in the forested northeast, hard soles for desert tribes like the Apache). These shoes were often so distinctive that some tribes could be identified by looking at their feet and a few were even named after them (the “Blackfoot” for example).

Indigenous moccasins have influenced several prominent shoe models in American (and world) fashion history. GH Bass’s popular “Weejun” penny loafer was marketed as a take on Norwegian fishermen’s footwear, but actually has its roots in a traditional Iroquois design (damn Scandinavians and their appropriation). The LL Bean laced Moc was popularized in the early 1900s as a vacation shoe for summer/fall in the Northeast. This cemented Moccasins as the leisure shoe of choice for WASPs vacationing in Maine who, in turn, brought them back to the cities and college towns of the northeast. This style became the quintessential Moccasin and supported a cottage industry of hand sewers in Maine that still survives today.  

**Why Mocs? The Construction of a Moccasin**

“True Moccasin” or “Handsewn” construction refers to a process in which one piece of leather, making up the sides and bottom of the shoe, are sewn together with another piece of leather on top that forms the vamp. This results in the iconic U shaped stitching along the top of the shoe. Typically a midsole and thin, often rubber, sole are then sewn on to the bottom of the shoe. Some shoes may use this moc style stitching while actually using a more common construction method – a goodyear welt or cemented construction for example.

This construction leads to a casual style of shoe that is supremely flexible and comfortable. Moccasins conform to the wearer’s feet faster and more completely than traditional welted footwear. I find my well-worn camp mocs to be even more comfortable than going barefoot. Handsewn shoes also have an element of personalization – the construction requires that these goods be crafted individually rather than by machine. Whether that yields any material value could be debated, but it certainly lends sentimental value. 

**Camp Moc vs Blucher Moc vs Boat Shoe vs Driver vs Loafer Mocs**

Modern Moccasin styles can be categorized using a few characteristics, but generally there is a lot of overlap between these designations and many brands offer hybrid versions that blur the line between one style or another. Generally, “camp” mocs feature only two eyelets whereas “blucher” (or “ranger”) mocs feature three or more eyelets. Boat shoes look like two eyelet moccasins but are often only decoratively stitched (a mock moc toe if you will) and feature siping patterned soles with a slight heel. Drivers are like moccasins with annoying little numbs on the bottom. Loafers are like Mocs but also totally different, so a loafer-moc is just a hybridization of two shoes that are simultaneously very similar and completely different.

For most, these can all be grouped together stylistically and substituted for one another. But for some (pretentious) purists, the differences in minor details and historical connotations provide the framework for modern wear. The biggest “rule” worth considering is that Mocs are fine with/without socks and boat shoes should be reserved for sock-less wear - although breaking this wouldn’t be considered a significant faux pas. 

**Recommendations at Varying Price Points**

&amp;#x200B;

* **\[**Minnetonka\]([https://www.minnetonkamoccasin.com](https://www.minnetonkamoccasin.com/)) ($50-$100). Not terrible if you’re only looking to try out the style, but some of the leathers are pretty plastic-y and they likely won’t last more than a few seasons. 
* \[LL Bean\]([https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/10587?page=handsewn-moccasins-camp-moc&amp;bc=474-629&amp;feat=629-GN1&amp;csp=f](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/10587?page=handsewn-moccasins-camp-moc&amp;bc=474-629&amp;feat=629-GN1&amp;csp=f)) (\~$80). While the quality of Bean’s mocs isn’t quite what it once was, the iconic shape is still there and IMO these are still worth a buy – on sale - for the budget conscious. 
* \[Town View Leather\]([https://www.townviewleather.com](https://www.townviewleather.com/)) (\~$120). Their “Ole Maine Classic” is one of the lower priced options for getting a true handsewn moc from a small business. The shape is not quite my ideal, but the price is great and getting to choose the color (pick honey) + lined/unlined is a nice option.
* \[Wassookeag Moccasins\]([https://www.wassookeagmoccasins.com](https://www.wassookeagmoccasins.com/)) ($125-250). Haven’t gotten to try these out personally, but they look excellent. Wassookeag focuses on soft sole mocs which ditch the rubber sole for layers of wrapped leather – arguably more comfortable and certainly more of a stylistic statement. 
* \[Rancourt and Company\]([https://www.rancourtandcompany.com](https://www.rancourtandcompany.com/)) (\~$250). Maybe the most recommended place to buy made in Maine footwear. Whether via MTO or a stocked model, Rancourt offers almost every kind of handsewn shoe in a variety of materials. Chromexcel, an oil-stuffed American leather, is their most used and is a perfect match for a moccasin.
* \[Oak Street Bootmakers\]([https://oakstreetbootmakers.com](https://oakstreetbootmakers.com/)) (\~$280). This Chicago-based operation is arguably more famous for their service boots, but they also offer several models of well made handsewns. I’d typically look at Rancourt first, but often Oak Street can be found for 20-30% off msrp, which is a great deal.
* \[Quoddy\]([https://www.quoddy.com](https://www.quoddy.com/)) (\~$295). My favorite mocs – unlined Horween whiskey camp mocs w/ red sole – are Quoddys. They charge a premium, but the comfort is there. 
* \[Yuketen\]([https://www.yuketen.com](https://www.yuketen.com/)) ($300-$600). For a style rooted in tradition, Yuketen manages to constantly bring fresh designs to the market. Although they make many of the standard handsewn models, Yuketen really shines when their designs get a little bit out of the box.

**How to Incorporate Moccasins into a Modern Wardrobe**

In terms of formality, Mocs can be thought of as equivalent to plain leather sneakers. Meaning they’ll work fine for smart casual outfits and may even be acceptable in a particularly lenient business casual environment. Stylistically, Mocs are at home with other Americana staples, but also have a spot in Ivy canon, particularly the popular “rugged ivy” aesthetic. In generally, mocs can be substituted anywhere casual leather boots would be appropriate - think flannels, dark denim, waxed cotton, and earth tone chinos. Likewise, they’ll work as appropriate summer footwear with most basic shorts / t shirt (or other casual shirting) combos. Moccasins are most commonly made of more casual leathers - pull up or pebble grain cow rather than smooth calfskin for example. Deer skin (or deer skin lined) and buffalo hide are also not uncommon and work well with the moc aesthetic as do various suede/rough out makeups. Generally, lighter brown leathers work more naturally in the summer while darker makeups pair more naturally with wool socks and heavier fall fabrics, but either could easily pull double duty.

Im 6’0, not skinny (110kg) and brown skinned.

I have a few interviews in London lined up for mid Jan.

I wanted to get a Suit Supply suit, and if it doesn’t work well, take advantage of their 45 day holiday refunds and get one in store. Better to buy online tho in case of delays etc

Can anyone recommend their suit ranges? They go from 250, 450, and 700. Is it worth expensive ones?

I don’t mind spending more on suits and if the 700 and three times as good it’s a no brainer for me, but obviously the law of diminishing returns suggest otherwise.

I’ll be buying one of the suits below, and probably get some white hankie or somehh thing for a simple pocket square. When I go to a tailor should I ask for anything in particular? Are London tailors particularly better? I have a local shop that has a London branch, could be worth looking.

353,malefashionadvice,"Hi, so this may be an unanswerable question, and that’s ok — I just want to hear some opinions. Basic info: I’m a nonbinary trans guy-ish (not on T, bind regularly except around family, relatively curvy and try to hide it, prefer masc androgynous presentation), my overall budget is low but ability to thrift and alter things is relatively high. I’m 22. 

Since I was young I’ve had many different interests when it comes to fashion, but was rarely confident enough to wear anything that stood out — and when I did, I felt shitty because it didn’t ‘look right’ (what I now know was dysphoria). It fluctuated and got more eclectic as my music taste expanded — 70s punk DIY, goth, mori, hippie, and more recently a very minimalist monochrome look. I mostly wore jeans and hoodies and flannel shirts. Now, I wear the same with the addition of more formal shirts and some flowy hippie-ish long sleeved shirts in the summer that are less about style and more to hide my arms. My style is actually a lot of functional stuff: baggy shirts to hide my hips, long sleeves to hide my arms (scars), etc. 

I want to branch out, but every week I’m enamoured with a different style, and it’s not that I’m indecisive per se, it’s more that I genuinely love several styles and which one I most want to wear varies depending on my mood. I don’t want to own a shit ton of clothes; I’m into minimalism and also don’t want to support fast fashion if I can avoid it. 
But I want to express all the different sides of myself, and have fun with fashion. I feel stuck: it doesn’t feel right to wear tweed and hand knitted jumpers one week, and full 2005 emo getup the next, and then suddenly switch to tie dye baggy trousers and a ton of jewellery. 

I know I could say “fuck it” and wear whatever, but I want to have a cohesive style that feels like mine, rather than like I’m playing dress up with other people’s styles. I’ve tried to find common ground between the styles I like, but all I have so far is this: dark, muted or earthy colours, androgyny, skinny jeans, “lived in” rather than overly polished. 

Any thoughts? Does anyone have experience combining disparate styles into something that feels cohesive?",How to mix styles in a cohesive way?

I've been a lurker here for quite some time, and just recently have gotten used to what my body looks like - 6'3"", 185 lbs, skinny fat going into athletic (thank you gym time). I've decided that with my new found confidence in how I view my body, I want to try and upgrade my wardrobe, starting with pants.

I usually wear about a 32 or a 33 inch waist, while the inseam has usually been between 32 to 34 inches. I try to find pants - be they khakis, jeans, dress pants, etc - that can withstand the constant wear and tear of being a middle school science teacher who constantly moves around in the classroom, but that's also flexible enough for me to use when I go out with friends to bars, clubs, or dinners.

- All listings **must** be posted from reputable platforms like Grailed, Ebay, Depop, Poshmark, etc. 

- All transactions are to be conducted through these sites. If you go offsite, you do so at your own risk.

- **All disputes should be handled through Grailed/Ebay/Paypal.**
__________________________________

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers. 

- Ask for measurements if there aren't any. Tag sizes vary wildly. 

If you want to do a trade: 

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection.",Buy Sell Thread - December 23

379,malefashionadvice,"I'm trying to cut down on the amount of possessions I have in general and part of that is that I'd really like to have clothes that I can wear from the gym straight to work without needing to change in between. I don't mind having to pack an extra button-down shirt to toss on over the gym t-shirt, but I'd really like to be able to find a pair of slack/chinos that will work not only in the gym, but also in a business casual setting. I don't expect to be able to find a three-piece suit that I can run a marathon in or anything crazy like that. But something that can handle a fairly simple morning workout (fairly basic PPL routine MWF) and still look presentable in a day-to-day white collar working environment.

381,malefashionadvice,"Hey guys, my situation is this. I'm working in London for a company where the dress code is quite formal (e.g. suits with dress shoes). I bought some M&amp;S black oxford shoes a few months ago that were relatively cheap at £60. However, the leather on the shoes has already started to come apart so it needs replacing. 

I've done some research and realised for my budget of £200-250, the loake 1880 [https://www.loake.co.uk/product/aldwych-black/](https://www.loake.co.uk/product/aldwych-black/) provide the best bang for my buck. However, the problem is that if i bought these shoes, I wouldn't be able to afford another cheaper pair to rotate it with. So I'd be wearing it 5 days a week, but this would only be in the office as I normally wear sneakers for my commute.

My alternative is to buy these good year welted shoes from Charles Tyrwhitt, costing £129 currenttly.[https://www.ctshirts.com/uk/black-goodyear-welted-oxford-toe-cap-performance-shoes/SHC0226BLK.html?cgid=shoes-goodyear-performance&amp;pf=browse#cgid=shoes-goodyear-performance&amp;start=2](https://www.ctshirts.com/uk/black-goodyear-welted-oxford-toe-cap-performance-shoes/SHC0226BLK.html?cgid=shoes-goodyear-performance&amp;pf=browse#cgid=shoes-goodyear-performance&amp;start=2)

That would mean I could then buy a second cheaper pair from Clarkes, and rotate those two shoes

399,malefashionadvice,"The clothing you wear is a physical depiction of how you choose to express yourself within the world in which you interact. This post goes through a couple of examples regarding common clothing choices and how it may be perceived by those around you.

EXAMPLE #1: Distressed and ripped clothing gives off a certain vibe.

That distressed leather jacket that’s well worn and aged says that you bought a jacket that is made with real leather that you have looked after it (or maybe not) and worn it as part of your core wardrobe for years (maybe even decades). You’re attached to this jacket, it’s been on your back and kept you warm locally, overseas, and through your many adventures. It shows character and it tells a story.

Those jeans that are ripped at the knee says you fell over, grazed your knee, got it caught on something or whatever it is, and you couldn’t care less. Perhaps to extend the life of this pair of jeans you’ve stitched or patched them together, or maybe not. They’re damaged and are hence not suitable to wear outside of the house. But you’re a badass who defies this social norm and wear them publicly anyway. People may think you’re too poor to buy a new pair, but again, you wipe your ass with these opinions.

BUT, what does it say about you when you’re wearing pre-ripped jeans from H&amp;M (or perhaps from a more exclusive brand/manufacturer) paired with a faux leather jacket? What’s the story?

It says you don’t value quality, or maybe you’re incapable of recognising it, or perhaps you can’t afford it. It says you’re fake. You’re desperately trying to give off this image of a tough dude but low-key you wouldn’t know real style/attitude if was staring you in the face. It says you’re the type of person who wants to look rustic on Monday, edgy on Tuesday, refined and elegant on Thursday, Minimal on Friday and Active on Saturday. The problem is, you’re really none of these (or maybe you are, I’m keen to read about this one in the comments). Buying pre-worn, clothing fake’s the previous sentiments outlined above and defeats the purpose entirely.

EXAMPLE #2: Most, if not all, clothing is made for an occasion as well as a matching level of formality. Let’s take the overcoat for this example. It’s a formal piece, designed to be worn over a suit (or something similar), with the intended function of keeping the wearer worm.

That overcoat you wear on the train to and from the office every day during the colder months says you know how to match your outfit to perfectly merge both form and function, keeping your style consistent and congruent. It says you’re as concerned with your appearance at work as you are when you’re not with your colleagues and boss. It says everything about you is professional. You pay attention to details, all the details, every single last one, on both yourself and the work you produce.

But, wearing this piece inappropriately may have the opposite effect in a different context.

You’re at the train station making your way home from the office, you’re wearing your normal suit and since it’s cold outside, you threw on a puffer jacket from Uniqlo. What does this say? It says your job required you to wear a suit every day. Despite this you can’t afford to buy a proper overcoat, or maybe you’re unaware of how incongruent you’re dressing is, maybe you can’t afford an overcoat (but low-key, if you can afford the puffer jacket for weekends, you can afford something more appropriate for the other 5 days of the week). It says you’re unaware of your surroundings. It says you cannot be bothered to make an effort and work is a place you don’t want to be, but somewhere that you have to be.

What about swapping that last one around? You’re meeting a friend at the local bar for a few beers. It’s a bit chilly outside and you’re wearing an overcoat on top of your white supreme teeshirt. What does this say? It says you own one because presumably for one reason or another you regularly wear formal clothing (perhaps you have a white collar job? Perhaps you’re the doorman at a hotel, who knows), and you decided that it would pair well with a teeshirt. It looks like can’t afford to buy yourself a more casual jacket to keep you warm in more casual situations. Perhaps you really don’t care that you’re more incongruent than a circle and this is some sort of act of rebellion? Alternatively, maybe you bought it to be fashionable, in which case you can site the above writing about how out-of-place it looks.

Your wardrobe does not need to be overflowing with clothing to suit every single style and occasion. But it should be consistent with the occasions you find yourself in regularly as well as being consistent with your personal style and aesthetic. Too many people want to be everything and so their wardrobe is overflowing with so many cheap pieces that don’t get much use just so that they can be “fashionable”.

**TL;DR** clothing looks best when it was bought genuinely, has been worn appropriately.","Context and Congruency: The clothing you buy, when you wear it and what it says about you."

455,malefashionadvice,"Hey all, after buying the leather Vans oldskool's last year I really got into ""minimalistic"" leather white sneakers. Even though the Vans have served me well, I can tell they're not of great quality. I don't want to pay 350 euros for CPs, so I've decided that I should buy the Svensson Classic Low's. I wasn't sure whether to buy Greats Royale or the Svensson's, but due to taxes and shipping the Greats are over 250 euros here in the Netherlands while the Svensson's sit at around 180 euros. Now for my actual question: what size should I get?

481,malefashionadvice,"I just posted in Menswear group, but this sub is probably a better fit.

Hello guys,

I am a 35(M) in need of a clothing brand that is complimentary to someone my size and age. My Work attire is easy- Jeans, Boots, and Dry fit athletic Polos....So what i am looking for are casual t-shirts for lunch on the weekend, or going to the in-laws, or if friends come over on a Saturday afternoon. (Make sense?)

But what I can’t seem to find is a brand that is relatively form fitting for my bigger frame. Im not in peak shape right now but somewhere between kinda muscular and kinda in shape/kinda not... which is why a tight fit would look bad on me, but I’m in decent enough shape to want a looser, yet form fitted look. I am barrel chested, bigger shoulders, and my torso is long. I have a 36”-38” waist to get a picture of my upper body. The only t shirts I currently wear (because they fit well with my build) basically are a large color assortment of Under Armour cotton/dry fit plain t shirts XL and XXL.... My wife says it’s time for some change.

I Haven’t shopped for clothes in a while but JCrew, Bananna Republic, Gap, etc don’t seem to make much past XL-which are so tight, I would have considered them to be mediums. I tried “Big &amp; Tall” But found out I am far from meeting that requirement. (Perfect for 6’5”, 300lb guys)

Long story short, I’m out of the loop on stylish brands that a 35 year old with a semi-large build and a semi in-shape upper body should wear. Thanks in Advance.",35(M) 6’2” 240lb’s- In need of a nice fitted casual clothing brand recommendation

I'm 6' tall, 170 lbs, and am halfway thin, but train enough that I'd like a better fit in my chest and shoulders, and I'm tall enough that mediums tend to be too short.

I'd probably just check out some of the well-reviewed shirts on here and take those in.",Made-to-measure or alterations on t-shirt?
483,malefashionadvice,"I've run into this issue where I'm stuck between small and medium for most apparel and most if not all of my wardrobe is no longer relevant to the way my body has changed after a few years of lifting.

Small fits perfectly around the torso but is too tight around the shoulders and arms, whereas medium is the opposite. Perfect around the shoulders and arms, but basically a dress around the torso. It's also slightly longer than I want it to be, but that's not a big deal.

This essentially means I'd have to tailor every M shirt I buy or deal with the lack of mobility that comes with wearing small. It fits fine if I'm standing still/walking, but the minute I have to reach for something it's tight and uncomfortable.

How do you deal with this? In the past, I would have just bought the medium shirt because I don't like when clothes literally hug my skin, but I'm tired of spending money on clothes only to regret it several months later because the fit sucks. At the same time, I can't online shop because even if I were to buy both sizes the same thing ends up happening with regards to sizing.

I spent some hours at the mall checking out fits (probably a bad idea the weekend before Christmas) and I couldn't find a single store where I actually liked how things fit.

Then throw in things like classic fit, classic stretch, slim fit, slim stretch, ultra slim and it's no wonder nothing fits right.",In between sizing sucks. The only options are to tailor everything or lose/gain weight for most brands.

I thought I would do a review on the [Threads of Apollo Odysseus Bomber Jacket In Olive Green](https://threadsofapollo.com/products/odysseus-bomber-jacket) as there doesn't seem to be much info out there on this company and their products. The company first came to my attention in 2018 during a [black friday sale](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalMaleFashionCDN/comments/a2imlz/special_offer_for_fellow_canadians_threads_of/) but at the time, I was too large to want to risk buying something that wouldn't fit or that I wouldn't like later on. 

I've had my eye on the company ever since, a little lame but I get very patriotic for small startups formed in Canada. And I love the story of what (Wakkas)[www.reddit.com/user/threads_of_apollo) has done and accomplished so far. Before purchasing during their 2019 [Black Friday Sale](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalMaleFashionCDN/comments/e3c99b/threads_of_apollo_fullgrain_leather_jackets/) I made sure to re-engage to learn about the company again. Their site provides a lot of background information about what goes into jacket. [1](https://threadsofapollo.com/pages/leather) [2](https://threadsofapollo.com/pages/about-us) [3](https://threadsofapollo.com/pages/faq)

I spent **$195 USD**($260 CDN) after using a coupon provided from the black friday thread. Before the coupon, the retail price is **$225 USD**($300 CDN). The price also has free shipping.

^(I actually had to edit this before submitting, and do a double take as I thought the $225 price was after sale price(not including coupon), and not what it's currently going for. I go more into detail about the quality at this price point in the review.)

#Details and Sizing:
I am 6'3"", 42inch chest, 210lbs of skinny fat and have been working on getting down to 180lbs. Yes, yes I know, I shouldn't buy products for weight that I am not at, but I carry the majority of that weight in my thighs. So I don't expect the jacket to change much on me. The jacket is made of full grain sheep skin leather which is *incredibility* soft and supple.

Feels like butter in the hands, so I don't think any compromise was made on leather. With sheep skin leather, comes the opportunity for the jacket to stretch as I wear. Which I think is important because this jacket is ***slim***. When the reviews and product mention that, you better believe it. Speaking with the owner he mentions that the model is wearing a size up than what would be ideal at his height/weight listed on the product details. 

Going by suggestion of the owner, I decided to get the jacket in an XL. I *think* the [jacket](https://i.imgur.com/uTA3mLM.jpg) hits my shoulders right, but I might be wrong? What do you guys think? I'm fine with the length, as I know some people do want higher cuts on their bombers. I'm not sure if going XL would have been the best bet to make or not. If I had lived in Vancouver, I think I would have tried the jacket in Large, XL and 2XL as the owner is gracious enough to let me people meet up with him and try it on.

At this size, I am comfortably able to [hug](https://i.imgur.com/oEksOiD.jpg) myself, wear a t-shirt, a sweatshirt/chunky sweater but *not* an oversized hoodie, like my Champion's Reverse Weave(Large) which runs large on me. That might change when the leather better stretches over time though. The benefit of the slim jacket is that it affords me to fit it under my North Face Gotham Jacket (Medium) with easy. To me, that makes this a great mid-layer winter piece as well as spring jacket. 

The jacket is lined with a wonderful cotton lining on the body as well as satin lining on the sleeves. This gives it such a premium feel every time you put it on. I don't understand why other companies don't use cotton lining. The breathability of this jacket is terrific. I don't feel overheated wearing this indoors with long sleeve vs when I tried on All Saint's leather jacket, I was running a bit hot after a bit of staring at myself in the mirror at their store. 

#Price:
I'll just come out and say, *I am blown away* at the price this jacket comes out to, even if I don't include the coupon. The quality is insanely good. To me this goes head to head with similar jackets at stores near me (Danier, All Saints) and honestly, goes a little ahead. And those are $600+ CDN jackets before sale. 

The stitching of this [All Saint's Bomber](https://i.imgur.com/3WMntD3.jpg) comes very close to the stitching of [ToA's](https://i.imgur.com/amBLX89.jpg). The All Saint's went for more top stitch detail however I think this might be more of a designer choice to give the jacket a more flat feeling to help with the overall slimness of it. Both look to be the same stitch per inch by eye, but I'm not sure.


ToA's adds a ton of [pockets](https://i.imgur.com/xnirU6R.jpg)on to the inside, which is very appreciated. It's something that goes the extra mile when it didn't need to. They are very deep and easy to reach while wearing. The details of the leather seeping far back into the interior really help with the overall quality of the jacket. The jacket just has such a *nice weight*. When you put it on, you can tell you got your money's worth. I can't emphasize enough that even though this is near Zara or even GAP(sale) pricing, it's way above it in terms of quality.

#Love:
These are just details of the jacket that I love that I'm going to list off:

* The length of sleeves is a great touch. To have them so long, but still slim after the elbow was a great design choice. I can't wait to see how they age 
* Again, the overall feel the jacket is just perfect. Not too heavy if it was something like cow hide leather but substantial enough that it feels soooo good to take off/on. 
* The cuffs are super stretchy while still staying tight. This helps with pulling them up to the elbow if you want to rock that style. I have lower quality and non leather jackets that are similar cuffs, but don't really allow any give in rolling up your sleeves. Can't obviously comment of the longevity of them but I don't have worries. 
* It's not listed in the details on the product page, but I believe the pocket lining of every pocket is a polyester microfiber, which lends well in being hand warmers
* No frills all the way. This can be good and bad. The packaging was simple, in a protected large envelope. With having a strict return policy, it being a small company(I think it's just two brothers doing the majority of the importing/selling/marketing etc), small product runs per batch, I imagine these are things that if there, would increase the retail price by a lot. I appreciate that it affords me to buy the jacket at such a low price. The owner did offer to allow me to buy XL and 2XL and return though if I had made that choice


#Gripes:

* The cuffs seem to pick up a lot of hair and fluff
* Although the zippers are YKK Zippers and are a breeze to go up/down on, the main zipper feels small to grab. I imagine it's a stylistic choice, but it can take a try or two to finally be able to connect the jacket together. I wish the zipper was big, and I might take it to a tailor to switch it out.


#Conclusion:

I have no regrets about this jacket as I usually do with purchases this large. I'm very happy to be at the ground floor for my purchase because I imagine as the company grows, the prices will go up to keep up with demand, customer service, new products, etc.


The Olive Green is a beautiful colour. Almost feels like a camo as the colour is not 100% uniform. Can't wait to see how the leather ages.

For the aspect of universal usage, I’m thinking the second one would be better as I feel I could wear it with anything and be okay.  The filson one also comes with an ironclad lifetime warranty that seems like they’d help you no matter what (important on a bag this expensive).

My budget isn’t too big of an issue, but I would like to keep costs down as much as possible while still having some good, quality choices. I’ll mainly be packing Tees and bringing a jacket for the cold weather, but I’m also open to long sleeve options if you have any specific recommendations. 

Thanks so much!!!",What are your top anti-wrinkle casual clothes?

29,malefashionadvice,"Sorry if this post feels a bit vent-y because I just got my only good item of clothing that has great sentimental value to me, stolen along with some other stuff from my caravan. It was a Conyack Belstaff Panther that was left to me by a dear friend. It was kind of my signature piece, and by far my favourite since it fit perfect.

I need to fill the hole in my wardrobe with another leather jacket. Now as a VERY indie filmmaker I can't spend 1500 quid on a new Panther jacket, so I've decided to get a low/mid range leather jacket to replace it for the aforementioned price.

I was considering getting a replica made of the Panther by LeatherCult in lower quality leather.

I also was thinking of getting a brown version of Shane Vendrell's Conyack 70s jacket with the buttons from The Shield, but my girlfriend told me I'd look like a cringy 70s wannabe since I also wear Hawaiian shirts often too.

Realistically I think I should go with either a brown (kinda hate black leather) moto style jacket or a leather harrington in the same colour. I'm not sure which goes better with my personal style - which is essentially just jeans and a slimfit hawaiian shirt or a long sleeved tee. 

But I'm open to all suggestions on any kind of leather jacket, and I'm pretty deadset on leather since I really don't like the look of down/parka coat or overcoat style jackets.

I don't if this will help in deciding what style of jacketwould best complement my body shape but I'll include details.

Eddie Bauer, not the best looking but budget friendly if they can handle the -23C to -28C as they said on the website.

But I'm trying to minimize wearing a lot of layers since I'm just gonna be outside for 10-15m max, wearing too many layers always got me so sweaty inside but warm enough outside, and putting on and off layers is a pain if you have to do it so many times everyday ):",Down Puffer recommendation?

73,malefashionadvice,"When I refer to ""back pocket"" I refer to the pocket found on the seat of pants. Mostly men's pants. There have been back pockets found on the back of jackets near the butt area for hundreds of years, but those are made to be thrown behind a chair and not actually sat on. The modern back pocket has always been an elusive instrument to me. Why does it exist? How did we ever get into this mentality that jamming our wallet under out butt cheek in sitting on a slant was normal? At what point in history did we say, ""You know what? Those pockets upfront aren't cutting it, I need more on my ass so that I can put something back there that is ok to sit on."" 

I started doing some very simple research, and as it turns out, the back pocket is a relatively modern invention. Now, I'm sure it has appeared throughout history a number of times, but as far as mass production, [it was introduced by Levi in 1901.](https://www.levistrauss.com/2017/01/12/pockets-full-history/) The important thing to note about this introduction is that the back pocket sits much higher up on the waist than modern jeans. Jeans in general were worn much higher up, so when sitting down, anything in the back pocket would rest on the waist, not below the buttock and not impeding on a comfortable sitting position. 

Eureka! I have discovered the truth. The whole concept of placing items in your back pocket while you sit on them is, in fact, a modern and idiotic practice. It was born purely out of the style changes of pants sitting lower on the waist and forcing items to rest not on the waist as intended, but below the buttocks. We were never meant to sit on our wallets. It's time we take a stand, pun intended, and stop this practice once and for all.","A note about the back pocket, and placement of things thereof."

I have slightly wider feet, but it seems that the lasts for both of these are much tighter than other 6 UK's i wear. I have an option to exchange but not sure if a 6.5 UK will be big enough, or if i should spring for the 7 UK which may look unproportional on my feet.

So, first of all, I live in Pakistan. And a shit load of big brands buy leather jackets from here and sell them abroad for hundreds of dollars. This particular jacket, that I bought from a factory that usually exports, costed me just about $30 (After discount and it was an export leftover item) Yes, that's true, and it's real sheep leather.

Now, with other non leather jackets, the best fit chest for me is 20 inches, which has got enough extra space and looks well. But the leather jacket I have ordered is about 21 inches, I want to now how much a difference can a single inch matter in case of leather jackets. The length, 26 inches, is, I believe perfect for me.

149,malefashionadvice,"Hi guys, most of my time I find myself only need to wear top and bottom. So I resort myself to Kamakura's OCBD, with the bottom of raw denim or Outlier's futurework. If a thin layering is needed, I have TNF's fleece vest or 3sixteen's Ranch Jacket. I try to find premium products as my core, such as two pairs of Alden in rotation and another pair will come soon. Or Red Wing's Merchants and Adidas Samba for the sake of versatility.

It's basic and I like it. The thing is I am a business student in a private university that's famous for its fashion department. People flexing Rick Owens, Common Projects, and Margiela on daily basis. Sure stuff I own and wear cost something and for those trained eyes in my school, they know I have an unconventional but respectable wardrobe for college students. But still, not sure if it is mentally insecure or what, there's a feeling of inferior when it comes to fashion game and I am really eager to bump it up a bit more.



Since I can only wear a few clothes due to climate, I am thinking about getting some wool, wool/linen blend trousers as a step up. Maybe getting more fleece like Patagonia's better sweater.

154,malefashionadvice,"I ordered one of the Brown Lambskin Jackets from Peter Manning back at the end of April, and was initially very satisfied with the product. It fit me great, and the leather seemed nice and supple. The lining was really comfortable and it was pleasantly warm despite being so lightweight. It wasn't long before the jacket got a couple white scuffs on the cuffs, but I didn't think too much of it.
However, now barely 8 months later and after a few gentle wears, I've gotten a horrible, gaping rip on the elbow out of nowhere. I'm not kidding, I wouldn't even have realized if not for my friend pointing it out. Looking at the rip makes me seriously wonder about the leather quality since the material is so thin and barely resembles leather (almost like a felt), and it ripped so easily without me even noticing. I'm not even sure about how to go about repairing the jacket because of the material and place of the rip.
I found out about Peter Manning due to glowing recommendations from others about the fit and quality, and have ordered several pieces from them with very happy results (I think I choked up a little the first time at how well things finally fit). However, I seriously recommend for Peter Manning to find better quality or tougher material for their leather jackets.
I contacted the company via email and put a one star review on their website, but the next morning it looked like the review had been taken down. I'm not sure if it's because it didn't technically qualify as a ""Verified Purchase,"" since I ordered the Brown Lambskin Jacket but had to post on the page for the Black Jacket after seeing the Brown one was no longer available as a listing on their site. Still, it leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth about a company that I'd otherwise had pretty good experiences with.
I guess joke's on me for not going with to someplace more known for their leather goods.

I went to go get a few new pairs a couple weeks ago and they completely changed the design and fit of them. They're super baggy in weird areas and just dont fit right. I found a clearance rack with the loose/ample style jeans. And by god they were the perfect pair of jeans. They fit so well! But they weren't very durable and started falling apart. Please help!

I'm a big dude but not crazy overweight, just generally giant. 6""2' 250, I usually shop big and tall shirts. I have a slim-ish waist and long legs. I wear W38 L30. Relaxed fitting Jean's but not baggy. Fits the ass and loose around thighs and shins. Just not super loose around my shins because that's one of the issues I'm running into.

I ordered the [LL Bean Maine Mountain size M regular](https://global.llbean.com/shop/Maine-Mountain-Parka/118939.html), however it arrived today and there is one major problem: it's huge. I'm tall (6'1), so the sizing guide seemed to indicate that M was what I needed, but being fairly slim it makes me look like a balloon, the shoulder seams are in the middle of my upper arms, ... it's terrible. No kidding we could put 2 or 3 of me in there.

So I'm back on the market for another parka, I'm worried that the Main Mountain in size S will still be too large (and it isn't available anyway).

Without going into Canada Goose pricing, I've figured that my options are basically these 2:

* [North Face El Norte](https://www.thenorthface.co.uk/shop/en-gb/tnf-gb/menis-el-norte-down-jacket-2zur): design of the hood is wrong, sleeves seem they will let the air in as well
* [Abercrombie Ultra Parka](https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/uk/p/ultra-parka-12407848?originalStore=ca&amp;seq=05&amp;faceout=prod): I've seen very little feedback on here about this one, the description of the filling is very confusing (what part is polyester, what part is down) and I'm quite unsure about the whole thing

I'm aware of the [Uniqlo Hybrid Down Coat](https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/product/men-ultra-warm-hybrid-down-coat-419992.html?dwvar_419992_color=COL09&amp;dwvar_419992_size=SMA002&amp;cgid=IDdown-parkas2167) being praised, but I'm concerned that it won't be warm enough for me, and don't really like the design either.

Am I missing any other decent parka within the &lt;800 price range that can be purchased in the UK without too much hassle? Ideally I'd be able to try it on since the LL Bean fiasco is already costing me £30 in shipping for the return.

240,malefashionadvice,"I am an Asian man with an average, a bit short build (173 cm, 70 kg), and I find it difficult to find ready to wear clothes in Germany. Everything here is big, any shop that I visit does not have my size (46 or 23 for suits, S/ XS for tops, and 31/ 28 or 32/30 for pants), so I have to do most of my shopping online. The thing is, it is very troublesome to compare sizes at home, because I have to order many sizes at once, and in the end, most of the items that I ordered have to be returned. I also have trouble finding sizes for casual jackets (not suit jackets) as their sleeves are long, and the length of the body is too long too. 

If I find something that fits me, usually the length of the sleeves (also the inseam for pant, I have never found any shop have 28 inch inseam in stock), and the hem are usually too long for my body so I look even shorter than I really am. :( The solution is to bring my clothings to a local tailor, but for that I have to spend like another 5-10 Euros per alteration, not to mention that it takes some time to have them altered, make it not so an ideal solution.

**New infographic rule**

Given a few recent infographics which can be variously categorised as bad, misleading, wrong, poor quality, etc, we the moderators will be modifying our previous rules on infographics.

The new rules is:

&gt; 3.10. Infographics will be allowed on a case-by-case basis. No previous allowed infographics will be used as precedent in our decision. Incorrect and/or very misleading infographics may be removed depending on moderator discretion.

The last sentence was the new addition for reference. 

We have come to this decision because even though people *do* discuss and give feedback in post comments the minority of Reddit users don't read comments, just view posts or images. In addition according to the [""fluff principle""](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html) on user generated voting sites, people are just going click or view pretty pictures, rather than long form text corrections or guides. This being the case the moderator team would rather nip bad advice in the bud.

**New infographic post flair**

A new post flair for infographic content has been added. It works across classic/old reddit and redesign/new reddit. Most old infographic content has been manually reflaired. New content should be flaired by users.

- All listings **must** be posted from reputable platforms like Grailed, Ebay, Depop, Poshmark, etc. 

- All transactions are to be conducted through these sites. If you go offsite, you do so at your own risk.

- **All disputes should be handled through Grailed/Ebay/Paypal.**
__________________________________

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers. 

- Ask for measurements if there aren't any. Tag sizes vary wildly. 

If you want to do a trade: 

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection.",Buy Sell Thread - December 16

402,malefashionadvice,"I'm 5'7"" and im a bit more built than an average (fashion) person my size, so because of this im usually between Small and Medium, it can go either way depending on brand, and even within brands. Sometimes even certain aspects of the clothing item are perfect, but another aspect doesn't fit right. And it just pisses me off that these brands make you base the size off of one type of measurements like waist size or chest size, because i'd think theres more variance between sizes than just those measurements. 

Like recently, I ordered 2 pairs of Roots slim sweatpants few weeks ago. Usually I pick a 32"" waist, because most of the time I see for some reason they skip from 30"" to 32"", but 31"" is really the sweet spot, so I go with small (30""-31"") instead of medium (32""-34""), because I don't want it too baggy, its supposed to be slim, and im also cutting right now so my waist is gonna get smaller. I bought them online cuz they were having a sale that was ending soon, and i've been real busy too. But I get them today, waist is perfect, the length seems pretty good too, but it gets significantly tighter below the knee, not constricting, but it looks more like tights, than slim fit. I'm also not used to slim fit sweatpants, so idk if this is how its supposed to be or if I look like a clown, the model pics they show seem to have a looser fit, but I know they also often use skinny models, so idk if its just cuz I have too much muscle on my calves and legs or if its supposed to be like this, and if I do try to get a medium, is it going to be any looser?

Sorry for the low quality photo. I have this Levi's jacket that I've worn a hundred times, but it's not really the right fit for me. It's designed for men with square torsos and it's very big, but im very thin and I often wear men's and women's clothing (the red button down in this photo is a woman's shirt). If there was a jacket that was the same style but much thinner and more fitted, longer, like down to my hips or so, with or without a waist cinch, I would wear the hell out of that. Would love to get a good one that will last (this jacket is like 4 years old).

However, it seems like the smallest sizes that most stores offer can sometimes still be too large for short guys. For example, Uniqlo's XS dress shirt comes with a 33"" sleeve, which is still too long for me as a 5'6"" guy. Meanwhile, they offer up to an XXXL with almost a 38"" sleeve. Are there really that many more huge, tall guys than there are short guys? You always see clothes made for the ""big &amp; tall"" but there's rarely any ""short"" sizes.

It's even worse if you are normally built besides your height. If you have average shoulders and chest, but are shorter than usual, you can't just size down because everything will be too tight.",Why are so many more sizes made for tall people than short people?

My problem is the price with a lot of those british brands from way back like Burberry, Aquascutum, Trickers or Barbour.

471,malefashionadvice,"I've decided to pull the trigger on the [L.L. Bean Baxter State Parka](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/60850?page=baxter-state-parka). Ordinarily, I would prefer Navy Blue, but that isn't an option. So, I'm trying to decide between Black, Kelp Green Heather, and Charcoal Heather. The problem is that I'm not crazy about any of these colors. 

The Kelp Green Heather looks *too* military-inspired for my tastes—unlike, say, certain shades of olive green. 

Moreover, while the Charcoal Heather looks great in the photo on the website, it appears to be much lighter in person—more grey than charcoal. For example, see the [following photo](https://i.imgur.com/zhToeGu.jpg) from this [Reddit review](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/9tvbch/review_ll_bean_parkas_baxter_state_vs_main/). I could be wrong about this though. I haven't been able to find many photos of the Charcoal Heather online.

As a result, I'm leaning toward Black. I'm just worried that it's too stark and less versatile than it might first seem.

478,malefashionadvice,"After seeing the post on this subreddit talking about the manufacturing ethical and environmental hurdles of creating leather products (cf. https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ealr3c/behind_the_scenes_a_look_into_the_ethical/), I just wanted to put in my two cents regarding the whole ""ethics of leather goods"" thing. What I'm going to write about is going to be a lot of talking points you may have already heard if you have been listening in on or are active in the debate regarding the ethics of eating meat, so if you feel you've already made up your mind about that topic and expect another bleeding-heart vegetarian/vegan to put their finger in your face and tell you you suck, then I'd like to let you know that I'm neither vegetarian nor vegan (although I would be, if I didn't have certain dietary/financial restrictions), and I will not at any point tell you you are evil for your actions. I'd like to open this discussion up for debate.

**Stats**:

Around 50% of the water used in the U.S. is used to raise animals ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste))

More than half of U.S. crop production by mass is used as feed ([source](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034015/pdf))

Most of the U.S.'s water pollution comes from the farming of animals ([source 1](https://ofmpub.epa.gov/waters10/attains_nation_cy.control#prob_source), [appending source 2](https://ofmpub.epa.gov/waters10/attains_nation_cy.source_detail?p_source_group_name=AGRICULTURE))

Land cleared for the farming of animals accounts for 80% of the Amazon Forest's deforestation ([source](https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/cattle-ranching))

The evidence is quite clear in saying that energy put towards the production of animal-based goods (to be eaten or otherwise) is inefficient and detrimental to the environment. If you have interest in conservation efforts, you should be buying products that reduce your environmental footprint and therefore should avoid purchasing animal-based goods (in this example, leather). 

""But in the other thread OP says he uses the hides of animals killed for meat production and is only *repurposing* what would otherwise be thrown away,"" you might say. The response to this is that it doesn't matter where the leather is sourced from; money put toward the repurposing of byproducts from the raising of livestock for food is still money put toward the raising of livestock for food. It is a degree better than the raising of animals solely for their hide (which is unimaginably wasteful), but it is still subject to the same ethical ramifications because both entail the environmental impacts of raising an animal. Some seem to feel as though leather is distant enough a product from a hamburger or lamb shank and so feel that the same reasons why meat consumption should be dialed-back/eliminated do not apply to leather goods, but demand for animal products is still demand for the raising of animals. In other words the blame is still there, it's now just spread out and smaller for those it spreads out to. 

Another point, leather goods are not a necessity. There are more environmentally friendly alternatives for materials out there (e.g. plant-based/vegan leather) for goods you may want to have made out of leather. Their is no functional difference between a wallet made of real leather and one made of plant-based/vegan leather, so, if you care for the environment, you should choose the latter. The only true difference between the two is aesthetics, with the former having an aesthetic quality that entails environmental harm. With this in mind, the question of whether or not you should or should not buy leather goods becomes whether you want to accept the responsibility of the harm you will cause the environment with the purchase of leather goods.

In conclusion, real leather is becoming an antiquated material with synthetic alternatives that do not entail the environmental damages brought about by using real leather. Purchasing it with the knowledge you have of the environmental impacts means that you are making an informed and ethically unsound choice. If you'd like some kind of syllogism, here it is:

(TL;DR)

1. Purchasing and supporting a product that is more harmful to the environment than its alternatives is ethically unsound. 

2. Leather is a product that is more harmful to the environment that its alternatives (q.v. ""**Stats**"" above).

3. Therefore purchasing and supporting leather is ethically unsound.

I'm not going to start with the whole ""is it ethically permissible to use non-human animals for anything other than maybe companionship"" thing because there's no obvious clear-cut answer, and reddit is definitely ***not*** the place I want to be discussing philosophical concepts. But the impact the raising of animals has on the environment is pretty clear-cut, so I thought I'd make a post about it.

484,malefashionadvice,"I got a brand new pair of all white Stan smiths (off white sole) yesterday and I fucking love them.

Out of pure excitement, I immediately wore them out - even though it was raining. It was only a drizzle for the most part and I was walking outside for about 20 minutes total, enough to maybe cover the surface of the shoe with light amount of water.

The thing is, I ignored the fact Stans are made of leather - and I had no idea that leather is susceptible to water damage. I applied no waterproofing, leather conditioning, etc that would have protected them. So I’m starting to worry that there I may have damaged/compromised the leather’s durability by wearing them in the rain.

On the other hand, I’ve seen a lot of people say Stans are a great choice to wear in the rain vs. regular sneakers. They’re a hell of a lot easier to clean, that’s for sure.

I know I’m worrying a bit unnecessarily, but should I be concerned at all about any damage/effects on my Stan Smiths from wearing them yesterday? More importantly, what steps should I be taking to maintain the durability and look (esp. whiteness) of the shoe regularly? Appreciate the advice

&amp;nbsp;


I have received blessings from the mods to post this and I am super excited!
A little backstory:

I started a luxury men’s leather apparel brand a couple of years ago. The whole idea actually came from this subreddit. I was getting into fashion and, thus, lurked this subreddit a lot. There seemed to be a need for high-quality leather jackets that didn’t break the bank. I was in a pretty unique position to do something about that, so I did! Fast forward a couple of years and here I am.

&amp;nbsp;


Two years ago, I posted in this [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/75xtmy/workers_of_international_brand_hm_being_treated/doa3u1i/) to shed some light on the working conditions when I first visited my supplier in Karachi, Pakistan. 

&amp;nbsp;

Like many here, I care about the apparel we buy these days and where it comes from. How the workers are treated and what the environmental impacts are like. I've been in a unique position to actually find this out so I wanted to take more advantage of that.

&amp;nbsp;

Recently, I went on a week trip to visit my supplier in early November to see all this again, albeit with a closer look this time. I was optimistic during my first visit and in my discussions with the supplier, but I wanted to see first-hand, in more depth, if the workers were being treated well and whether the environmental impacts were being considered.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are [some images and videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EZdxCtB3i95oYIUgAJ3wZPkEwiEGueJv?usp=sharing) I would like to share with you guys!

&amp;nbsp;

**Please note some videos might be loud and contain noise not suitable for a workplace since they are raw and unedited.**

&amp;nbsp;

The supplier I deal with employs around 40 workers. They specialize in low quantity but high-quality leather goods. They get the leather from a wet blue place (all they do is, source and organize wet-blue hides), that goes to a tannery and then to my manufacturer for cutting and stitching. These videos and images are from all of these places.

&amp;nbsp;


The main things I came across and was pleasantly surprised by:

&amp;nbsp;


**Working Conditions**


&amp;nbsp;

• Like many, at first, I was always concerned about how the workers were treated. If they wanted me to “hide” anything etc. But fortunately, it looked like a very “lively” place to work! The workers worked decent hours, got plenty of breaks; they were free to mingle and talk and crack jokes.

&amp;nbsp;


• When I met with my supplier, we would constantly get interrupted (in a good way). Basically, any person that had a question or update was able to express that to my supplier in an open manner like a team.

&amp;nbsp;


• When talking to all the workers and from the interview that I did with one of them, it was clear that it was a family-run place and those who weren't related by blood were treated like family.

&amp;nbsp;


**Environmental Impact**

&amp;nbsp;


This was super impressive. The biggest knock on leather in regard to the environment is the harm it does to the local water supply (all those chemicals used to tan the leather going into the water etc). I wanted to focus on that. 

&amp;nbsp;



After the whole tanning process is complete, the water, from **all** the tanneries in that sector, goes to a reservoir where the water gets homogenized into a certain quality. The videos I have up, have the guy explaining it but I’ll type it out here as well:

&amp;nbsp;



• The water first goes through a sedimentation tank where sludge is removed (the sludge ends up getting used as fertilizer). 

&amp;nbsp;

• The water then goes through a UASB reactor where anaerobic reactions take place where COD and BOD contamination loads are reduced by means of methanogenic bacteria. 

&amp;nbsp;

• The water, after 24 hours, gets shifted to an aeration tank where the sulphur is removed in the form of Hydrogen Sulphide. 

&amp;nbsp;

• Finally, the water goes through another sedimentation process (Secondary Sedimentation) to remove any remaining sludge before the water goes back to the local supply.

&amp;nbsp;

Body type: I kind of have an awkward body type: 5'5"", 170 lbs, disproportionately longer legs, and have poor posture (anterior pelvic tilt so my butt sticks out and forward head tilt). I measured my chest to be 39"".  

I purchased two different blazers from Macy's since they were on sale (Nautica and Ralph Lauren), sizes 38S and 40S. I plan to return all but one. The 38S is kind of tight around the shoulders so I think 40S is the way to go. I attached photos of me wearing the Lauren 40S ([here](https://imgur.com/a/Dpk5p2f)). Can someone give advice? I feel like I look super awkward. The shoulders are still slightly tight, but not a big deal. Also the jacket seems puffy/sticking out around the chest (Lauren not as much as the Nautica). However, the jacket seems too big around the mid-section. Especially when I unbutton the jacket it does not lay flat against my stomach but rather pops out. 

1) Should I keep the Lauren 40S and get it tailored? What aspects of it would get tailored? Definitely the sleeve length since it is too long, but can any other improvements be done? 

2) Or should I return everything and purchase something else?

62,malefashionadvice,"Hello,   
First, if this is counts as a simple question please remove/let me know and I will remove.    


I have always struggled with my sense of style (and aesthetics in general!): I have never known what to buy, where to buy, or had any faith in my ability to pick out ""cool"" clothes. Growing up, I NEVER bought clothes - I would wear things I got for free through hand-me-downs, free clothes from events or sports, etc.  It always has been a site of anxiety for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am looking to improve my look and feel more comfortable with myself, and hopefully build some confidence in the way I dress. I feel like I have a few outfits that I am okay with, but it is very ""basic bastard"", and still a little bummy.  I know I would like to get more clothes, but I can never figure out what direction I should go with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I am thinking about donating a large amount of my clothing that just sits in my closet (both old stuff and stuff I thought I might wear when I bought it, and then never ended up wearing), and slowly building up my wardrobe to something I actually like and feel confident with. I have looked at some general styles, and I am most pulled towards streetwear but honestly don't know if I could pull that off, or even where I would begin.

&amp;#x200B;

Here a few pictures of outfits I will keep, to give an idea of where I'm at right now (which has honestly been a big step for me this past year). I notice that the only things I feel comfortable getting is plain, dark (black or navy) and light (tan or grey) clothing.  Shirts with buttons have always been intimidating for me, as I never know when to wear what, and what level of fancy everything is.  Shoes are another place I am pretty lost.

*Processing img mncaqiynki441...*

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img c49wjmhrki441...*

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody have any suggestions on how I can start building? Of course, I have been browsing this sub but I am honestly kind of at a loss, and it is very hard for me to imagine what clothing looks good on me, and am VERY easily pulled towards comfortable and plain hoodie/jeans type outfits, which I know are kind of lame/bummy things to wear on a regular basis.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am open to any and all thoughts and opinions!

Thank you!","I have no imagination, any advice? What can I do to grow a sense of style?"
63,malefashionadvice,"Hello, I've been looking into MTM websites for a formal event in the spring and I'm a little stumped on the choice, with very little information online as well, from what I've seen.

The reason I choose MTM over store-bought is because I have odd measurements that no retailers near me offer off-the-rack and the nearest tailor costs an arm and a leg to get something good, therefore; MTM. Only problem is I have no idea where to look. 

A lot of people suggest Luxire but their measurement system is all off and whenever I put in any measurement, it immediately corrects the measurement to something else. For example, I put in my inseam of 28"" and it instantly corrects to 38"" and such. It's quite frustrating and worrisome that I won't get a good product. (I understand I still may get faulty product given that I'm not being tailored in person but a 10"" inseam difference is devastating.)

On the other hand there's Hockerty but given a low amount of recommendations, I don't know how much I should trust it.

The color does not matter much but I really want the same fabric and the design. The fabric was a thick and solid one, it made sound like two pieces of cardboard brushing each other when I walked.

167,malefashionadvice,"Well I just bought the J.Crew Kenton Leather Chelsea Boots and I'm not at all happy with them. They're very uncomfortable to wear and I don't see them holding up for long, unless they're handled like a baby. 

1) So far I can see the leather being vulnerable to fraying at the edges of the opening. My other nice pair of shoes has a protective layer there since y'know jeans/pants and ankles/feet are going to be rubbing against these edges often. I noticed there's someone on eBay selling a nicely frayed J.Crew Chelsea.

2) For the comfort issue, the insole heel length is 3 inches before it goes into a steep slope where the insole becomes thin and hard. Whereas my nice pair of shoes has 4 inch for heel where it then slopes gradually and softly. My heels are longer than 3 inches and I have small feet. Both shoes I compared are size 8.5 medium.  I normally wear a size 9.

I'm no expert on shoes or feet so forgive me if I sound like an idiot, but wth? I thought these Chelsea boots were decent. It's not surprising they're made in China. The other pair I've compared them to are USA made Johnston and Murphy.   I don't see the point in J.Crew goodyear welting a shoe when the shoe is likely to fall apart or be thrown away after causing injury before the sole wears out, must be a marketing thing.

173,malefashionadvice,"Hello all,

I'm currently in the process of deciding on some lace up boots, either Thursday Boot Captains in Old English (Dark Brown) or Brandy (Light Brown). I currently wear cowboy boots to work most days and that's fine. However, I'd like to be able to wear my chinos/slacks to work and those looks kinda... Unusual with cowboy boots. 

So, I've decided on some lace ups for casual/business casual wear. 

Now here's the big question, all of my jeans/chinos/slacks have ""standard"" cuff sizes. None of them taper and none of them are ""skinny"".

Are those acceptable to wear with lace ups, or are tapered/skinny  or rolled up pants required?

Also, most of the wardrobe is Khaki, blue, dark blue-light blue denim and black pants. Dress pants are Navy blue, green and grey. Would those pant colors invalidate/clash horribly with the boot colors I'm looking at?

On the first pair I had an issue with a hole forming by September. I noticed a crease and next a hole forming. It’s really frustrating as these are not shoes I do any running or extensive walking in. I wear these while I drive my car, and while I’m at work.  I sent them an email and they responded with a replacement pair right away. They didn’t ask any questions just “hey here is a code go ahead and order another pair on us”. So I thought cool, I get the 2nd pair by October, held off on wearing them so much as I started wearing boots and other things with fall coming around. So my use of the shoe is even lighter. I wear the 2nd pair maybe once or twice a week. 2nd tear forms in the same area. I emailed them over thanksgiving week about the issue they haven’t replied. More so, I’ve emailed them a couple of times since then about 4-5 and have not gotten one response from them yet.

194,malefashionadvice,"Have you ever been to a wedding where the groom wears a colored suit and tie but the groomsmen all wear full black tie attire?

I’m part of a wedding where the groom will be wearing a burgandy jacket, black pants, and a burgandy paisley neck tie. The bride chose for the groomsmen to wear all black tuxedos with white shirts and bowties. 

Question 1) Have you ever seen this? It feels like the groomsmen will be dressed more “classy” than the groom. I feel like black suits would be better to maintain the chosen color without mismatching the form of attire of the groom, no?

Question 2) The bride doesn’t want us to wear our vests, as this would not match the groom. But we are not wearing cummerbunds either, and wearing a tux without either of these is wrong, no?  

Question 2 Part 2) Furthermore, and I guess this question isn’t so much a rule as an opinion question, if she is worried about the lack of matching, isn’t that an issue inherent in choosing the groom to wear a different style of outfit from the groomsmen (not to mention the colors are already different)?

I guess I just feel like this was somewhat poorly considered or looked into and I feel like the groomsmen will be dressed for a black tie formal whereas the rest of the wedding party and guests will be dressed for a slightly less formal environment, comparatively.

**W**ho doesn’t love sneakers, countless brands and various designs that they became more than sport wear but a lifestyle ! From Adidas to Nike to The classic **Reebok**.

For more than 30 years Reebok hasn’t only been an innovative brand, but one with great messages as well.

**“The Reebok Classic leathers areclassic because people who wore them made them classic by bringing their styleand personality to them”** Reebok gives a clear message that the shoe doesn’t define you , YOU define you .

For both men and women, Reebok classic proved to be iconic ! After launching  the first running shoes, Reebok gained great popularity as their design were chic, casual and stylishly fashionable . They became more of casual street wear that could be worn anytime !

Reebok classic evolved from different designs such as Classic leather, Freestyle and the workout and many more.  They all now under the Reebok classic umbrella.

 

## Who wears them ?

Men are obsessed with Reebok trainers ! We see celebrities as Kendrick Lamar wears them. In  2016 Reebok collaborated with Kendrick Lamar to launch The Kendrick Lamar x Reebok Classic which is for the whole family ! “How cool is that !” and their latest design Club C  aims to promote unity and justice .**“Nowmore important than ever for individuals to come together as one. This sneakerrepresents that call for unity and equality , while also pushing people to lookbeneath the surface and uncover the hidden messages. This is something I try todo with my music, and now here with club C”** Kendrick says .Reebok always demonstrated their love to creativity and arts as we witnessed several collaborations between Reebok and rappers, from Jay-z , Rick Ross and one of the longest collaborations with the producer/ rapper swizz beatz releasing lately the DMX Series 2000 .In 2017 we saw a turning point, as for years other sports brand were leading  the list , Gigi Hadid, the super model started wearing Reebok Classics , and still does including all the designs, and owns them in countless colors !And just recently the one and only **Cardi B** joined the Reebok squad, presenting what Reebok does the best , being CLASSIC !Cardi B was put into a challenge , of her knowledge of the 90’s , from fashion to slang -  the Bronx raised artist totally nailed it !**""Everything that you love about Cardi B is whatyou love about Reebok,"" the brand said in a press release, adding,""there’s nothing we love more than taking risks and standing boldly behindthose who do the same.""**https://www.instagram.com/p/BpzcM5ElnFy/?utm\_source=ig\_embed

258,malefashionadvice,"###I saw couple of guides here and they are great, but my brother wanted to get into fashion and he is in highschool, a year from college. So he was my project for couple of days. What i will write here is a list of clothes i have in order to look good and to turn some girls heads around, which is to be honest what we all want to do. Aint that correct?

1. **FIT** - i know you already expected this to be number one, and it will always be.(Disclaimer: if you want everything to fit good on you the workout). When buying clothes look for them to fit properly. In order to do so, start from the biggest size and try out all until you reach the size in which you look like an idiot. Now take the one that is tight around your body but you can move your arms freely. For t-shirts you want them to be tight as possible but not make you look like a douche, you want them to fall freely. You will have to figure out on your own. And the shoulder lines should be on your shoulders, obviously. Hoodies can differ, you can grab a bigger size if you want to, but generaly you should go with nicely fitted ones. Jeans, i generaly go for skinny ones or slim. They should be tight around you legs but not too tight, let your legs breathe a little. You should be able to do a squat i them and they should, idealy, fit you without a belt. And they should touch your shoes, if they are too long then they are either too big for you or they are made to roll them, so try it.

2. **Buy a lot of black and white t-shirts**. You can wear them with whatever you want, buy the ones that are plain looking. Then the ones that are a little bit nices, maybe a little pocket on you chest. And you can buy graphic ones. But dont go overboard here. I have one black graphic tee that has Mona Liza over it and behind is like a universe and there are sprinkles of paint. Just buy them and wear them either benath hoodies or flannels or whatever. Also you need to buy the ones that sre not just plain boring. I dont have advice here, just buy the ones you think look cool. Just ask someone before buying. So you dont look like an idiot.

3. **Flannels**. You can google “flannel shirts men” and you will get the idea. You csn look awesome in these, just wear black or white tee beneath them and you are golden. You can buy black and white ones, yellow and black, red and black google and pick the ones you like.

4. **Hoodies**. You should habe at least one of these. Plain hoodies with no graphic on them will make you look badass and stand out from all the other who wear oversized ones with something stupid written on them. You can also go here with abstract kind but only if you are feeling it. If not then dont. Buy black, grey, navy blue, beige goes great with black jeans. Plain ones are the best in my opinion or the simple hoodies. Just simple. 

5. **Henley shirt**. Oh boy do i love them. These you should buy in every color, im joking dont do that. They look great and you can rock them however you want, just put them on, some jeans and a pair of chelsea boots, plain white sneackers or black vans/converse and you are good to go. Grey, black, navy, white. 

6. **Sweaters**. I have red sweater that i wear occasionaly and grey one with something black on it. Also just plain gret sweater. You can rock these whenever. When going to school grey goes with black perfectly. Red also, you can wear them with jeans too. I wear white or black tshirt beneath. Maybe some of you can write in comments more about sweaters?

7. **Shirts**. Get the ones that fit you properly and are one color or with something on them, just please avoid the ones that will make you look like you got them from you long dead grandfather. Black, white, red, navy are the colors you are looking for. You can get the ones with lines and stuff but i personaly like the one color shirts or with verticsl lines but that are more spread appart. I love the white ones for summer, casual. I also like short sleeve shirts for men. I have black one with brown buttons and red roses all over it. Hawaiian are also cool if you are into it, google “simple hawaiian shirt men” i like those for summer. If you have a great body then you can rock them easily. 

8. **Jeans, trousers, joggers**. I have jeans: Black, black ripped, grey, regular denim, blue washed denim, some blue jeans my mother bought me, another black and grey, white ones. Trousers: chinos in khaki that i wore once ,maybe, black chinos. Joggers: light blue, navy blue, black. Thats it. You can buy something like that. You can never go wrong with black jeans is what i say frequently. 

9. **Athleisure**. I have a couple of pieces that i wear to the gym. Maybe to the store, thats it.

10. **Shorts**. I have couple for gym. Buy whatever as long as they are above or right at you knees. I have couple that are like jeans, black, blue, i have cotton ones(too much to count) that i wear at the house or to the store or with something casual when im going for coffee. I have short chinos, whatever they are called, that are cool. 

11. **Buy boxer briefs.**

12. **Shoes and boots and what not**. Here we go brothers. White sneakers or white converse, black vans or converse, chelsea boots in suede (brown, black or grey) or you can get leather ones, black is best imo. Black or brown combat boots. That should be enough. But it never is....

13. **Socks**. I am joking. Who gives a fuck, just buy black and white ones. And some with funny stuff on it, just for fun. 

14. **Outerwear**. I am getting lazy so i will just write them out. Suede brown bomber jacket, black bomber jacket, denim jackets with or without fur, leather jacket. Coat, black, grey, navy or camel. Blazer, black and navy are the ones i have. I dont wear them that often so i dont want to give advice on it. Guys that are more suave than myself please add in comments what i missed. Jackets, i like parkas, it is cold where i am and they keep you warm. 

15. **Accessories**. Buy a watch, bracelets for sure. Rings if you are into them, silver ones are the best. Belts buy brown and black. Necklaces, buy something subtle, dont go over the top. 

16. **Buy a nice smelling fragrance, please.** Watch Jeremy Fragrance on yt for more info.

###I forgot some things for sure, so if you could please add in comments what you think i got wrong or what should be added. Thank you.",Buidling a wardrobe for 16-19y olds.

294,malefashionadvice,"Hi All,

First time post in the this forum, and I’ll explain the title more in depth. Clearly the “fast fashion” concept has brought down the quality of what the majority of us buy. I’ve been mainly purchasing JCrew for the last 6-7 years and have seen their quality slowly diminish and business model slowly turn to the everyday sale that is Banana Republic. Although I occasionally find something I like, the majority is cheap (I get it, they have to make a profit). I am beginning to have the same issues with my business attire. Here, I look appropriate at the start of the day but by the end of business everything is stretched to shit and falling apart. Also, items aren’t lasting as long. My question is, who do you all buy from that you still makes quality apparel. I feel like I’m buying the brand thats established themselves at a certain price point but is slowly lowering their quality while hanging onto the fact that they cater to a certain income level. I guess I should say that I am looking in the price range of 50-100 for a piece of clothing, 100-250 for anything business related (a piece, not the entire suit). I’ve found a lot from Everlane and they fit my style overall. The denim still actually feels like denim and not my girlfriends yoga pants. Brooks Brothers has caught my eye for business after feeling the shit offerings from Bonobos in person the other night. I bought my tux from Suit a Supply and loved the quality even after the button fell apart the first wear. I’ve had good luck with Allen Edmonds and some older JCrew with shoes (the latter doesn’t suffice for shoes anymore).  Who do you all find the best overall quality from?

I don't normally post on this channel but the other day after I met with an image consultant made me take my fashion into consideration.

So we (My Youtube Partner) met with this image consultant who basically critiqued my current wardrobe and gave me a 'new look' which I am really happy with.

I look like more of a Gentlemen and to be honest, I have gained more confidence at work and in my personal life. 

I feel more approachable, but I still have a ways to go before I achieve what I want with my final wardrobe - it definitely wasn't a 'cheap' makeover, but it was a true transformation.

These are some old potato cam pictures of a blazer I used to adore. It had high quality, thick, interestingly textured material. A pleather-ish collar that made it pop. It was almost punk/alt but still dressed up. I could wear it with jeans and a t or a collared shirt. It was so versatile, and so ""my"" fashion. 

I lost it in a move and have been trying to fill that hole in my wardrobe with a series of blazers that really just miss the bar. 

I still have that burning desire for a coat I can wear regularly that is fancy but causal, high quality but edgy, rides that line between artist and corporate drone. Maybe some zippers where they don't belong or a weird highlight stitching, I don't know.

No clue what my old blazer was called, but I think it was in the Kenneth Cole Reaction line? Maybe 5-7 years ago. I doubt it is atlu d anymore.","Looking for a blazer that is different, and works both dressy and in t-shirt/jeans"
314,malefashionadvice,"Hello! I hope I’m not breaking any rules in this post but if I am then feel free to remove.

I have been invited to a company holiday party where the dress code is semi-formal/formal. Now I’ve been invited to such events before but being self conscious and all prevented me from going but this time I’m going to conquer that.

I don’t really like suits personally but my knowledge of blazers and how to style em is limited to some blog posts here and there. This is my outfit idea so far for this party:

- navy blazer 
- white dress shirt
- brown shoes similar to [these](https://www.callitspring.com/ca/en/CIS/Men/Footwear/Dress-shoes/Lace-ups/Erorenna/p/11017359)

Now my questions are regarding a few things:
- Tie or no tie? If so what kind?
- what type/color of pants?
- pocket square?

Also I have some nice boots (Thursday captain and scouts) and slim fitted jeans and was thinking of pairing this with the blazer for the future office wear, any recommendations as far as blazers go and how to select one?

318,malefashionadvice,"Hey guys, 

What are some of your biggest underwear complaints? I have an idea for a new mens underwear design that I think will change the game. Unfortunately I cant post the idea here for obvious reasons. I have been searching for the perfect underwear brand for years without any luck. Its always something with each brand I try whether it be the legs riding up or my balls rubbing up against my leg etc. Have you tried SAXX? I have and I guess I have a love hate relationship with them. They feel great when I first put them on but as the day goes on there is just something not right with the ballpark pouch. Its weird. My biggest pet peeve is when Im working out and my balls rub up against my leg and I have to try to wedge the underwear fabric up in between my legs and my balls, ya know..in that crack up there. Anyone else have this problem when they are working out? 

I have a few questions.

1. Is the leg riding up really that annoying? Some brands advertise theirs dont but they all do.
2. Have you ever worn an underwear like SAXX? Did you find the ballpark pouch to be a little annoying? 
3. Would you wear briefs if they weren't so unattractive? 

Thanks in advance for your feedback

328,malefashionadvice,"White collar job dress codes have been considerably relaxed. It is good because there is no need to have 10+ suits but it is slightly bad because it just killed the male wardrobe - now one is left with the dilemma of what to do with all the suits in the closet.

You pull one out and you suddenly look overdressed or like a peacock among casual millennials and then dudes who just wear whatever, especially in New York City 

I ditched the suit in 2016. I finally did it with sadness. Then I started doing mismatches - beige pants, navy jacket, white shirt and tie. And I would throw in different types of ties and just vests. I did bow ties too. I love bow ties. 

My ties had an evolution. For many years it was 3.75 inch classic ties. Then as suits got more tailored, it was between 3” and 3.5”. 

Then I collected knitted ties and it was always between 2.75” and 3”. Too slim knitted ties look weird, too wide knitted ties look grandfatherly.

So since ditching the suit, my fave combination always was checked pants, white/pink/blue shirt and a knitted tie. And a jacket on top without pocket squares. I ditch ties and bow ties if I am doing pocket square. 

The only time I had the bowtie and pocket square together was in my wedding. Black tux and all.

In 2018 and all through 2019, I ditched the tie completely and went with plain shirts and plaid pants, many patterns. 

I got sick of this and 2 weeks ago, I pulled out the knitted ties and it felt just good. Something about the flat end and the narrow 3” blade is very appealing to me and I don’t feel like I am underdressed or overdressed. Feels formal with the right touch.

So, my current outfit:
Lilac houndstooth button cuff shirt 
Checked pants 
Wholecut brown shoes 
Navy knitted tie 
Navy jacket 
Beige trench coat on top 

So fellas, let’s bring the knitted ties with the flat end back.",Bringing back the knitted tie for the formerly white collar job dress code male

What you'll tend to see in their place are infographics, images that try to condense some basic advice into something digestible for most people. Infographics aren't always bad-- [this Styleforum infographic on how to proxy clothes from Japan](https://journal.styleforum.net/how-to-buy-direct-from-japan/) is basically as helpful as the [guide I wrote on proxying](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/an3tof/a_guide_to_proxying_from_japan/), but easier to read. It's hard after all to get people to read anything on Reddit. Just look for posts where the commenters clearly haven't looked at the article linked. Infographics can be a great way to get people to learn something quickly, especially for something so visual like fashion.

The problem is, a lot of the infographics we see take off are either inaccurate or too vague, which defeats the purpose of them. If you're looking for advice on suits, something like ""fit is king"" isn't really helpful. Beginners don't know what ""fit"" is, and unless you offer some visual examples, you've really added nothing except another meaningless mantra for beginners to repeat. There's a reason why so many of the comment sections [of these infographics](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/6goeys/visual_guide_to_mens_dress_codes_business_casual/) have long term users pointing out mistakes or weird phrasing. Blogs love infographics because they're upvoted so quickly and shared widely, even when they have issues.

Are there good infographics? Sure. [This infographic on sleeve rolling](http://i.imgur.com/f7IeLVj.jpg) isn't life-changing, but there's nothing inaccurate or nothing really to add there. [This guide on laundry care symbols](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/63gfks/an_easy_way_to_interpret_fabric_care_symbols/) doesn't promise to be anything more than it is. But we've seen a lot of infographics that claim to be all-encompassing and then leave out crucial information and leave readers no better than before. It's especially frustrating because while regulars might know better than to follow them verbatim, we get a lot of traffic from new users who might end up wasting money on badly worded advice made to drive traffic to a blog.

I've brought up [what good advice looks like before](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/c9gw5e/weeklyish_fashion_discussion_what_does_good/). How do we make sure good advice rings louder than bad advice? Do we need to start making ""good infographics""?

376,malefashionadvice,"I’ve always hated wearing suits because I’ve never felt handsome looking wearing one. It really comes down to fit and style- I’m Asian, relatively skinny/ fit, and maybe an inch below average in height. My chest is a bit disproportionately larger than my shoulders/ arm thickness, so often t-shirt sleeves are baggy on me but fit just right around my chest.

Shopping for casual clothes that fit me well and that I like the way I look in has been a long and hard journey over the years. But I’ve finally found brands and styles/ cuts and sizes that I like. I wear a men’s size SM or XS depending on brand and cut/style. Most American brands’ SM don’t even fit me flatteringly.

I don’t wear suits often, maybe 1-3 times a year. But I dread donning the suit I have every time, because I hate the way I look in it.

I’ve come to the conclusion that the next suit I buy must not be bought at Joseph A. Bank or Men’s Warehouse. I need to invest in a quality suit that fits me well.

So I have a couple questions:

- Is my budget of $1,000 reasonable?

- Can you recommend brands and places to buy a quality good looking suit that have a more modern fit? I hate dress pants that are baggy in the crotch when sitting and prefer lower rise waist.

386,malefashionadvice,"In the search for a comfortable pair of jeans I ordered a pair of barbells in late September.  I have seen them on the JRE podcast and through ads on the internet, both featured glowing reviews. They appealed to me through aesthetic and function.  I have larger thighs from working out and I often have to deal with pants not fitting right or not having a full range of motion.  I thought barbell would be different.  I was wrong.

They lasted until late November, a little over a month of use.  I got around 1 month of 120$ jeans before the zippers teeth broke.  I tried emailing their help line and contacting Amazon to get a replacement pair but received no response.  I generally did like the fit and feel so I chalked up the broken zipper to user error.  So I decided to have the zipper replaced, got them back from the tailor's today and when I try and take them off the rivet that is the top button broke in half.  It appears that Barbell has gone down in quality exponentially since first arriving on the scene.  The fabric might be nice but the quality of the stitching and hardware used is built to break, and their costumer service is non existent.

I just wanted to warn all of my big thigh brothers to avoid these Jeans, and I would love to know if you guys had any recommendations for jeans that feel and fit like barbell, but will last me a long time.  I'm willing to pay 120$ for something that is actaully worth 120$, but Barbell Jeans arent.  To put it as my old weight coach would say, Barbell jeans are so weak they couldn't break their way outta a wet paper bag.

However, there was a manufacturing defect on the shoe. As I was trying my new boots on, the pull tap came off ripping a piece of the interior lining along with it. I messaged Joshua through the live chat and he told me to send him an email so they do the procedure for refund.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was great, until this happened.

I send the email about the broken shoe, with pictures to their email address. Didn't get a reply for a week both email and online. So I filed a PayPal claim and resent the email. They responded within one day after the PayPal claim with return label sent to me. But they said they can only refund me if I CLOSE THE PAYPAL CASE. For a company with a working website and a return label sent to me. I did not hesitate to close the PayPal case which I CANNOT REOPEN, Paypal only allows you to open the case on a single transaction once. If you close it that's it, you cannot file another dispute.

&amp;#x200B;

I sent the package back via the return label they provided me. The package was received more than 2 weeks ago, it has been more than 10 business days. My emails were ignored once again and my refund not received yet.",FromTheFirst Customer Experience or should I call it a scam experience?

Upon rewatching John Adams on HBO, it occurred to me how much I might enjoy, on occasion, dressing up in early American colonial dress.

Although I'm sure such an outfit will draw some attention, that isn't my goal; I simply want to express myself and my interest and connect further to our history through this homage.

I need help selecting a color and finish that would be versatile enough to pair with most of my outfits while not having to worry too much about scuff marks. I work in an office setting that is business casual. I usually wear jeans/chinos and an OCBD on Fridays I usually swap out my OCBD with a plain T-Shirt. I live in San Diego, so I don’t have to worry about rain or snow 80% – 90% of the year. 

I have my eye on Arizona Adobe Captains, however, they don’t come in wide sizes. The colors they do have available in wide are brown, terracotta, black and natural. I can see if I can make the standard sizes work, however, if I had to choose from the wide options I have available, I am leaning towards brown and terracotta. Between these two, I like the brown the best, but I am worried about scuffing the finish. Terracotta’s matte finish might lend itself to gaining some character after getting a few scuffs here and there.

I actually had the chance to visit their pop-up shop in Austin, TX, and I was actually pleasantly surprised by the quality of the clothing (considering it’s an Express company). Their joggers and sweaters were thick and seemed durable and comfortable, not to mention super soft as well. However, I was disappointed that most of their clothes had percentages of synthetic fibers like polyester and acrylic and nothing seems to contain more premium fibers like wool.

Express’s new brand seems to be focusing on the millennial audience seeking more transparent and purpose-driven companies. UpWest focuses on providing you with not only cozy clothes (sleepwear, hoodies, joggers, etc.) but also cozy home accessories (candles, blankets, etc) that make you more relaxed and at peace. They even have an UpWest Foundation that aims to donate $1M to organizations that resonate with their values. It seems like an interesting concept—haven’t heard of anything similar.

441,malefashionadvice,"So I’ve been on somewhat of a journey to find a look that I really feel at home in and that also works with my lifestyle.  

To be honest, I started as a trend chaser, and didn’t really give it much thought beyond trying to look cool, until a coworker at and old job referred to me as “a man of many looks”.  That was years ago, but it really got me thinking about what “my” look might be.

As a middle aged parent of young kids with a connection to skate culture and a job that affords me the luxury of dressing casually (as long as it’s still presentable, pretty much - no strict dress code), I’ve really taken to a more minimalist style.  I’ve managed to whittle my wardrobe down considerably, and I’m getting happier with it and feeling more like it represents my aesthetic tastes and worldview all the time.

But of course, after putting money into a more refined version of my wardrobe and starting to explore MFA and other fashion publications, I’m back to wondering: what’s better, having a consistent “look”, or a wardrobe that encourages playfulness and experimentation?

- All listings **must** be posted from reputable platforms like Grailed, Ebay, Depop, Poshmark, etc. 

- All transactions are to be conducted through these sites. If you go offsite, you do so at your own risk.

- **All disputes should be handled through Grailed/Ebay/Paypal.**
__________________________________

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers. 

- Ask for measurements if there aren't any. Tag sizes vary wildly. 

If you want to do a trade: 

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection.",Buy Sell Thread - December 09

456,malefashionadvice,"Howdy,

I'm Kent Wang. I make everything for men, from [sneakers](http://www.kentwang.com/shoes/sneakers) to [suits](http://www.kentwang.com/suits) to [sunglasses](http://www.kentwang.com/misc/sunglasses), and even some obscure items like [chopsticks](http://www.kentwang.com/misc/dinnerware/ebony-chopsticks.html) and [lip balm](http://www.kentwang.com/misc/lip-trip-lip-balm.html). I know that our [polos](http://www.kentwang.com/polos), [minimal sneakers](http://www.kentwang.com/shoes/sneakers), [pocket squares](http://www.kentwang.com/pocket-squares), and [Bauhaus watch](http://www.kentwang.com/misc/watches/bauhaus-watch.html) have all been discussed a bit on MFA.

How it started: back in 2007, I wanted some plain white linen pocket squares with hand-sewn edges but couldn't find them anywhere, so I decided to have some made up. The minimum amount of fabric shops will sell is a yard, which makes eight squares. I kept one for me and sold the extras on Style Forum, and everything took off from there. I still work under the same motivation as when I started, to make things that I want for myself.

I run my business differently from most other retailers. We never do sales; our prices are low year-round. We sell direct to consumers without typical retail markups. You can read more about our [retail philosophy](http://www.kentwang.com/about).

[Last time I did an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/2orpwf/im_kent_wang_ama/) was 4 years ago. Since then, we've added a lot of cool stuff like [sunglasses](https://www.kentwang.com/misc/sunglasses), [touchscreen gloves](https://www.kentwang.com/misc/gloves), [shawl cardigans](https://www.kentwang.com/outerwear).

On the personal side, I moved into an RV/motorhome with my girlfriend and our four cats ([our Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fulltimingfelines/)) and we're currently enjoying the sun in Spain. Our team is mostly remote, with people in Canada, New York, and Texas.

Things I would love to talk about:

* Pocket square designs. Do you have an idea for a good design? Post an image and I'll tell you what I think about it.
* Ideas for new products, especially knitwear. The [shawl cardigans](https://www.kentwang.com/outerwear) have been extremely popular, beyond our expectations. What other knits do y'all want? Something with a hood? A pretty normal zip-front hoodie? With something special to it like wool, cashmere, and/or cable knit? Throw me your ideas and I'll tell you what I think.
* Remote working, digital nomad, RV/vanlife
* Minimalist wardrobes
* But feel free to ask me anything

Currectly I'm using a 10 years old Protest ski jacket, which is way thinner than the ones I can find in any local shop today.

With these I can use it in the city or put on the extra stuffs and go hiking in it.

The invite says “cocktail attire,” but given our culture I’m not sure what that means. It could be for real, or it could be a catch-all to set a standard and make sure some dumbasses don’t show up in khakis and an oxford.

Needless to say I want to be the best-dressed there. I know ultra-formal cocktail attire often calls for darker suits. I have a black suit that I’d rather not wear (a little too formal), and a charcoal suit that I’d have to buy another pair of pants to match with, so that’d be a chore.

This leaves my best suit. Light gray Banana Republic suit, faint herringbone patterning. It fits great and matches the light blue French-cuff shirt  and cognac-colored leather loafers I planned on wearing. And I look absolutely fabulous in it. Like, think mid-1980s gentleman with a vintage car he drives on the weekends.

I’d rather not buy a whole new wardrobe for this, and my company’s weird casual culture sort of confuses how to dress for the party. I also don’t want to look like a complete idiot or like I don’t even know what I’m dressing for.

135,malefashionadvice,"Okay so lately I've been trying on a few longer coats to smarten my personal style up a bit and move away from more youthful looking jackets which I tend to gravitate towards. Unfortunately I've realised that I look short in trench and parka styles. Now I'm 5ft 10.5inches, (179cm I think), which shouldn't rule me out from being able to wear longer coats I'm thinking. So maybe it's that I've been unlucky and the styles I tried on were too long for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Example of last one I tried on: 

[https://www.mrporter.com/en-gb/mens/product/bellerose/cotton-blend-ripstop-hooded-parka/1169921?ppv=2](https://www.mrporter.com/en-gb/mens/product/bellerose/cotton-blend-ripstop-hooded-parka/1169921?ppv=2)

&amp;#x200B;

Looks great on the model, but I look short and odd in it. Tried on size M, and it felt baggy on me too.(I usually take a size M or L in most things).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking that maybe there's a rule to it. There's a length you shouldn't go past in relation to your height, or else you look shorter. Something like that. The missus says the same thing about skirts. After a certain length she just looks shorter so has to avoid a lot of below the knee styles. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also wondering about raincoats and how formal they can look, anyone got any ideas on how to get the balance right. Maybe one with hood can still look like workwear but avoid looking too bankerish when worn more casually?","Love parkas and raincoats on other people, but look short in them myself!"

**tl;dr:** Loooong post. Complete beginner here. This is what I have, and the combinations I actually wear. What should I buy and what else should I do? I'll probably do whatever reddit recommends. Pictures here: https://imgur.com/a/nNSzRHH

-------

Hello! I live in Belgium. I'm 29M, autistic, and really, really don't understand fashion. (I don't understand what colours work well with what, if something is coordinated, or if something looks good in the first place.) I'm thin but currently gaining muscle mass (up to 65 kg now from a min of 55), 178-180 cm tall depending on the time of day, and (I haven't measured) I apparently have long forearms and lower legs.

During uni, I had jeans that were too big for me and t-shirts, as well as a heavy coat for when it was cold. Now, I have a fiancee and have moved to Europe, so **I want to look good.**

The first time I got clothes for myself was this past June (H&amp;M), and then twice with Uniqlo (once in Brussels and once in Japan). (I go to Japan once or twice a year, so you can give suggestions from there too). When I'm on my own, I ask the store human to pick for me. Now that I have multiple, I'd like to know what I can wear with what, and what I should buy that I do not already have. **My current budget is almost 300 euro, increasing by 50 euro per month until March, by which time I'm hoping to have bought everything I need.**

I'm going to list most of the clothes that I have in categories, with a code so that it's easier for you to give combinations unambiguously. Most of them are hand-me-downs from my little brother, and are apparently a bit too big for me. Items that I bought this year have a \*, and the ones from Japan with my fiancee have a \*\*.

I've included pictures of every item I wear (in Current combinations below) and a few more, but let me know if you want pictures of other items too.

-------------

# Current combinations

Variables:

* (PS1 or PL1) with (T1 or T2)
* PS2 with T1
* PL1 with T4 + YL3, with W4 if it gets colder
* PL1 with (T4 or T5) + (W1 or W2)
* PL1 with (YL1 or YL11 or YS1) + W3

Constants:

* C1 and O3, and possibly O4 when it gets colder
* C2, O1, and (O7 or O8) when it's really really cold
* S2 in the winter, S3 otherwise
* O5 basically all the time (I use O6 for US1 or US2)

YS1, O1, O3, O8.

I've been told that S2 + PL1 + anything + C1 + O4 makes me ""disappear"", and that PL1 and W2 doesn't look that good, so I'm considering getting the black version of PL1 for those cases.

# Questions

* What should I do with the clothes that are not part of the current combinations?
* What else should I buy? What colour?
* How should I combine the rest of the clothes, and your recommendations?
* What should I wear when it's not winter? (i.e., too cold for short sleeves, not cold enough for C1).
* What kind/colour socks should I wear? (Does it matter?)
* How do I know if clothes fit? (I already saw the sidebar, thought I understood it, but didn't find it useful IRL.)
* How do I know how much clothes will shrink?
* How do I know if clothes fit given that some of them shrink? I wouldn't have the shrunk version to test with.

---------

# Learning

Where can I learn fashion/to build heuristics related to fashion, especially since I don't have the intuition (yet?) that something looks good in the first place. I've been reading up on things for just over half a year now, and it's still analytical (look at rules to see if it's okay). Often it's vague, or requires you to use your intuition to make the judgement.

Some examples of ideas I'm having trouble with:

* How can I tell what kind of look I should go for? I know some things I don't like (e.g., if the clothes are torn, or if there are drawings or signs etc, or if I can't bike properly (I test that by seeing if I can squat)), and very few things that I know I like (e.g., monochrome item of clothing, except e.g., my fiancee liked YL2 very much and told me to buy it, so I think I'd be fine with patterns too), but I can't really tell what looks good on me on my own. In general, the fewer clothes the better (I'd rather be naked/clothes feel heavy on me), but I understand the importance of layers and the discomfort is secondary anyway. (And one layer is about the same level of discomfort as 3 or 4). But tags bother me.
* What kind of colours are ""earthen""/""natural""/""from the ground""? (That's what store humans recommend for the most part.)
* Some advice is contradictory: You're supposed to use different colours, but you're also supposed to use different tones of the same (or similar) colours. (How do you know if colours are similar? What I think is similar (e.g., beige and yellow, or dark blue and black) are not, but ones that I don't think are similar (e.g., beige and green or brown) are.) And when using different tones, it's a certain order of darkness that you should use (I put my camera on black and white to check). But if the multiple tones are too similar than it gives a washed out look, and if they're not similar enough it can be jarring (?).
* At the same time, you still want 抜け感 (nukekan, sense of something missing??? Not sure how to translate that). For example, the white line on S1 between black and brown. That's when you do something ""wrong"" on purpose to make it look good. But if you do the something ""wrong"" wrong, it looks bad. And if you do it at the wrong time, it also looks bad.
* And all of that just looks like ""clothes"" to me.
* Etc etc etc.

Do you have any recommended sites/trainers that can help with that? That don't already assume I have a certain level of knowledge or intuition? (Essentially, start from the absolute basics.)

I looked for information Todd Snyder's cashmere but didn't see anything on here so I'm posting my experience.

I ordered the cashmere v neck sweater and the cashmere turtleneck.  I am taking the v neck back and maybe the turtleneck for a few reasons:

\- Made In China 

These retail between $300 - 400 bucks but I got a nice Black Friday 30% off on them, but I would still expect sweaters that cost so much to be made from another region of the world rather than China.

\- Build Quality

The quality of the cashmere is.. okay.  I wish I knew where the cashmere originated from.  The fabric is extremely soft like most cashmere, but it isn't as plush as other brands.  It is mid weight, but I could easily see myself buying a comparable product in the $150 - 200 range.

\- Price

This is a confluence of my previous two points.  I just don't think that these are worth the cost.  If they were about $100 cheaper they would be a good deal but I can't say they are.  I may order a few Proper Cloth sweaters to see how they feel and I know with those the cashmere is sourced in Scotland.",Todd Snyder Cashmere Thoughts

162,malefashionadvice,"I work at a grocery store and am often standing up for upwards of 8 hours at once. We are required by our dress code to wear jeans or cargo pants to work, and rightfully so, because we should look presentable.

However, I'm looking for a pair of sweatpants that would look almost identical so I could wear them to work without anyone knowing. I don't mind spending a bit, but I'd prefer to keep it around $30.

Another thing to note would be that we are not required to tuck in shirts and they can run long so it doesn't even need belt loops because that shouldn't even be noticeable. With or without is not a dealbreaker for me.",Sweatpants Jeans

187,malefashionadvice,"So for Black Friday it seemed that the Eddie Bauer website had some crazy deals. $35 heavy flannel $38 chinos and so on. I placed an order as a guest, put in my credit card and thought I would be waiting for some goodies. Well I never receive an email receipt. Weird, check my card and they have put in a charge for my exact order amount. I follow up via email and get told there's no record of my order and that they can do nothing. Call up customer service 2 days in a row disputing the charges and trying to find my order. After 3 days of no luck finding my order with EB, my card company kindly removed the charge from my account. 

At this point though I want my items and the deals I was offered on Friday. So I follow up with another call last night with all of my question ref #'s and try to get my Black Friday deals. After over an hour with a woman ""helping"" me, She initially only offers me 50% off my order which is the exact promo they are currently offering on their website, and still $45 more expensive than my first buy. So then I have to dispute the order again to get it closer to the original sale. After this she starts taking down my address, email, card info.  She gives me an order number, and the phone call ends. Just for me to realize 24 hrs later. Still no email receipt, and when I type in my order # on the website nothing shows up. 

I'll be following up with an in store manager to continue to push these complaints up the chain, but be warned.

I recently purchased a Schott Raven leather jacket, but I'm having slight doubts about the fit, curious about your opinions.

I'm 5'6, 138lbs, chest is around 38"". I bought a size small, which I felt looked and felt the best. However, I'm now wondering if it might've been too big. I tried size xs in a different model, which was difficult to get on and off, and felt more restrictive. However they didn't have the xs in my model. It's a lambskin (although fairly robust lambskin), and as such will most likely stretch over time.

Worth noting is that I like to lift weights and I'm nearing the end of a cut. Normally, or in the middle of bulking, I weigh closer to 145/150lbs.

I've worn shirts, depending on brand, from small to medium. 

I want the jacket to look stylish, sexy, and masculine.

What do you guys think? I know the sleeves are long, it's designed that way, so I'm not worried too much about that. Besides that, I would love to know if it looks too big, sloppy, or otherwise different to what I described the ideal look as.",Leather Jacket Fit Check? Schott Raven

I have a wedding that's Black Tie preferred, specifically stating Tux or Dark Suits. I saw this too late, and only have a navy suit. Also, I wear a suit about once per year, and bought a nice, well tailored suit for that purpose. If I bought a suit last second, it'd have to be a cheap H&amp;M suit, untailored.

Since it states dark suits are ok, I figure a navy suit shouldn't be a grave sin. However, I think black shoes and navy suits don't mix well. Is it better to grab some black shoes and a black belt to blend with the dress code more, or stick with brown to match the navy suit better?

Side question: What color tie would be best to wear with a navy suit at this event? Regular tie or bow tie?

I've got one in mind:

 [https://www.rmwilliams.com.au/men/clothing/jackets-vests/heritage-drover-jacket/JD2030101.html?dwvar\_color=CHOCOLATE&amp;lang=en\_AU#lang=en\_AU&amp;start=1](https://www.rmwilliams.com.au/men/clothing/jackets-vests/heritage-drover-jacket/JD2030101.html?dwvar_color=CHOCOLATE&amp;lang=en_AU#lang=en_AU&amp;start=1) 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had good experience with RM Williams. I own and wear a pair of their Comfort Craftsmen almost daily - easily the best and most comfortable shoes I own. Hell, my belt is RM Williams; passed down from my grandpa. Still holding together. 

  
Everything looks solid to me, the price is right according to most posts I've seen about leather jackets here. I own a black double rider style jacket already, so I'm happy to go with the brown and particularly with this style. A style that I honestly don't know the name of.  


**Concerns:**

***Leather quality*****.**   
The last time I saw one of these in person was last year. I was almost reverential because of its thousand dollar price tag. I recall the leather being exceptionally soft - but, given that it's cowhide, I'm dubious as to what the leather quality could be. I would EXPECT full grain for the price, but I'm concerned I'll wind up with top-grain or genuine leather. Not ideal considering the $1000 price tag.

&amp;#x200B;

***Fit.***

Unfortunately, since there are only about 5 in stock in Australia right now (and they're all on the east coast) I'm not able to try one on in person. I spoke to the sales team over the phone and they believed I *should* fit the Large perfectly. The chest measurement for Large is 42 and my chest measurement, incidentally, is exactly 42 inches. Considering that leather jackets are supposed to fit snugly, so far so good.   


Unfortunately for me, I'm not in the best shape of my life right now. I stand at 5'11 and weigh in at 226 pounds. 180cm and 102kg for the metrically minded. All other measurements clock in almost perfectly; at least when I compare it to my other jackets. But I'm worried about my damn beer gut and whether or not I'll be able to zip the bloody thing up. Not that I really **intend** to, but for $1k you'd expect the option to be there. The sales team suggested that the XL would likely be too roomy for me given that these jackets are meant to have a very close, tailored fit. But I'm dubious. I normally go for XL in outerwear but, I'll admit, oftentimes it does leave me looking a bit on the boxy side.

297,malefashionadvice,"After researching a lot on how-to choose a more sustainable shoe (one that will last a long time) and diving into the world of CP alternatives - I recently ordered from two Portuguese retailers: Jak Shoes and Onism.

The Jaks arrived in a few days, I believe the Onism is pre-ordered and being made at the moment.

# TL;DR

* Royal Hazel colour is stunning.
* They certainly look and feel premium from the outside.
* The leather insoles are super slippy in socks but incredibly well cushioned under the heel.
* I'm having trouble with the edges of the tongue digging into my feet - it's pretty painful at the moment.

# Design

I chose the Royal Hazel model from Jak and WOW - these things are beautiful. I've noticed a few people looking at my feet walking to and from work - they are really eye catching and just look premium.

# Build

The build seems really solid, the leather is smooth on the outside, the laces are delicate to look at but strong and the soles have weight to them that suggests a premium rubber sole.

The inner sole is padded and my word is it comfy. My heels haven't felt this good in VANs, Converse, Adidas etc.

# Fit

I ordered my regular size and they definitely fits however I am having some issues.

First, the leather lining is super slippy in socks. Without socks it's fine and I plan to wear them without socks in the Summer but in the middle of Winter, I'm going to need socks. I've tried both dress socks and sports socks and while the sports socks make the shoes tight, I feel they're better suited to the Jaks.

The one bit I can't get over at the moment is tongue. The edges of the tongue are quite stiff with it being where the leather doubles up and it's pretty painful to walk in at the moment. I'm hoping this subsides in time, I'm on day 3 and it's still pretty painful - does this get better? I don't think sizing up or down would solve it as it would mean the problem gets worse or the shoe will slip off my heel.

298,malefashionadvice,"Hey!

I (20/M) was born with a sensory processing disorder and as a result I can only wear clothes made of super soft fabrics. It's a big problem. I can basically only wear clothes that feel like a soft sweater.

Anyway, I've been looking for casual button down shirts. The problem is that all of the button down shirts I see have this thin, paper-like, excruciatingly rigid feel to them - they're never soft &amp; relaxed like what I'm looking for.

The fabric is exactly what I'm looking for, but it's an odd shirt and I can't find anything like it online, so I'm asking here for help. Does anyone know what kind of fabric/material this is and how/where I could find other button down shirts with a similar composure?

So my questions/concerns are:

1. I think I may have went overboard on the T-shirts.
2. I ended up spending about $350 total after taxes, is this a reasonable cost for these items?
3. Did I get a good range of colors?
4. I still need to buy jeans and chinos (is 5-6 pairs in dark wash, black, khaki, navy, gray a good idea?)",Major Wardrobe Overhaul -- Did I buy too much at once?
308,malefashionadvice,"I'm in a bit of a pickle.

TL;DR:  My ideal size would probably be a 42.5, leaning up; a normal person in my body would just keep the 43- but should I size down because I can expect some stretching?

I should be a \~43-44; hearing I should size Common Projects down, I bought a 42 and 43. The 42 is pretty damn tight everywhere; the 43 is relatively tight as well- but it has the slightest heel slippage.

My initial thought definitely says the 43 fits better, but I'm worried that with wear, a 43 would end up slipping at the heel even worse, where a 42 may actually end up breaking in and stretching into the perfect fit..?  
To further complicate things, I have other chelseas that fit comfortably despite having MORE heel -toe room but LESS heel slip specifically because the sole flexes, where the CPs' new, chunky sole won't \[nearly as much\]- SO, maybe the sole will break in a bit, reducing heel slip, making the 43 perfect? OR IT WON'T SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IT'S CHUNKIER??  
I also found some contradicting information on this general topic online- but one source did suggest that slight heel slip is okay, and that I should be able to get an index finger behind my heel without too much work/pain- if true, this would point me towards the 43.

I guess it can actually pretty much comes down to this: Over time, will the heel slippage get worse or better? If it will get worse, can I size down and expect the upper to stretch a bit?

This cheap pair of sneakers lasted for quite some time, I guess it's mostly because I only wear it during the warm days as I prefer to pair it with no-show socks. I do take it often when traveling as it is lightweight.

Debated between Kent Wang, Koio and Svensson. Finally pulled the trigger on Svensson as the price and review seems good (got it $193 shipped). The leather quality is definitely a major upgrade to me, the linings are made of leather and has much softer padding inside (it was polyester in Nordstrom shoes). The profile does look a bit less slim though but it's hard to notice unless you put them side by side.","After 4.5 years, I am retiring my beaten up nordstrom white sneaker (""Novato"") and got a pair of Svensson."

I bought a peacoat recently, but I'm worried about the length of the peacoat on me. For context, I'm 5'7, 150 lbs. I love the fit of the peacoat besides the length: it extends past the bottom of my crotch by 4-5 inches. It's beginning to feel like a topcoat rather than a peacoat as the peacoats I've seen are somewhat shorter. Is this something I should go to the tailor for, or should I look for a peacoat that's shorter in length? I feel like peacoats should end at the bottom of the crotch, but I may be wrong.

338,malefashionadvice,"So, I'm 5'5"" and about 160 pounds (hoping to slim down when life isn't as crazy). I have some big interviews coming up and I decided to pick up some new quality dress clothes for the them. I wen to Men's Wearhouse to get measured and the man said I am ""comfortably a 16.5 neck, 31 arm""  and purchased 4 shirts. They are all extra slim or slim fit, but they are very baggy around my stomach and arms. I don't have super skinny arms either. Why is this so baggy? What measurement affects this? I assume not the neck or arm length.

The dress shirts I believe that fit me the best are the H&amp;M small dress shirts. (Example: [https://www2.hm.com/en\_us/productpage.0781758005.html](https://www2.hm.com/en_us/productpage.0781758005.html)) Yeah... Basically the ones made of paper.  I own a bunch of those but was hoping to upgrade to ones a little bit nicer. Basically I want the same fit with better fabric and durability. It seems H&amp;M shirts measure 14"" neck and 24 1/2"" arm length ([https://www2.hm.com/en\_us/customer-service/sizeguide/men.html](https://www2.hm.com/en_us/customer-service/sizeguide/men.html)) How is this possible? I generally don't button the very top collar but I don't see how the rest of the shirts remain so huge. Does the neck circumference just suck the entire shirt in, and 2.5"" off then neck make that big of a difference? 

So...

1) Can someone explain to me what I am miss understanding when it comes to dress clothes measurements?

2) What is the H&amp;M small dress shirt size and how can I get that translated to other dress clothes?

3) How I can basically purchase some dress shirts the same size as H&amp;M smalls but higher quality?

380,malefashionadvice,"As a young lad in my early 20s I'm very into fashion, I'm into classic fashion or as sometimes I refer to it as 'dad' fashion. Dad fashion for me is nice suede Chelsea boots, skinny-slim jeans, nice toffee turtleneck and a shawl neck cardigan followed with some tortoise shell half rim glasses.

The style I have mentioned is what I like, I also enjoy evening and general formal wear, for someone in my early 20s its pretty different to most, a lot of people walk around with ripped skinny jeans, ankles on display, no show socks and a pair of nike air max 97s, printed tee and a hoody of some sort. There is no issue with what I have just mentioned, you do you.

because my style is different from what I'm usually exposed to I like this subreddit for inspiration, I feel as though everyone here has a similar taste, a lot of  the fashion is more sophisticated and classic.

I decided to follow a few instagram pages (tomfordmen, menslaw etc) but honestly its all terrible, aside from advertising clothes than only look good on an extremely thin mannequin which has a waist size of 10 inches and shoulders broader than a boeing 737s wingspan... Its the fits.

The goddamn fits man, I tell ya! Everyone commenting on ""this is how all men should dress!"" ""classic style never looked so good"" hundreds of thousands of likes on these pictures. It's all either very lean guys with a little visible mass wearing suits (3 piece or 2) that are almost skin tight, Skinny fit is a thing, I get it, I enjoy skinny jeans! However a fully skinny suit with trousers that look as though the seams will burst when you bend slightly, jackets so tight you can see the fabric bunching and pulling all over when standing straight. How on earth does anyone see this and like it? I think yeah okay SOME of the pictures are OK looking I guess but its insanely impractical for anything other than having your picture taken, although most of the time the suits look so tight and crumpled that it looks horrible.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just wondering how this has become a norm for a lot of people? I understand skinny suits can look good but to me a skinny suit should be something tailored but maybe brought in that little bit more to really hug the body, hug, not squeeze until circulation is cut off. Its the same with everything though, getting extremely muscular guys to wear ultra skinny clothes that make them look huge cause they already are, massive IFBB pro athletes I mean, who wants a turtle neck that is not only tight on the chest and arms but also the belly and waist that extends to your mid thighs? Even then, the skinny suits usually have guys that are either extremely lean with a little mass and shape or just really skinny men, these guys would look fantastic in a tailored or slim suit, there is no need for the abnormal and impracticable suits they wear!!!!!!!!!!

387,malefashionadvice,,Does Anyone know what jacket this is?
388,malefashionadvice,"So past Black Friday I kind of impulse ordered a super nice APC bomber. It came earlier today and I loved everything about it, fits perfectly... except for the sleeves. I'm a shorter guy at 172cm or ~5'8, so the sleeves were just a tad too long and bunch up a bit. I asked a few of my friends and they all said it looks fine, especially I usually only wear it outside a sweatshirt or sweater anyway but well it still irks me. So I wonder if it's possible and if it's worth it to get a tailor to shorten the sleeves by 1.5 - 2 inches.

389,malefashionadvice,"I know Asos is huge in UK, and honestly I find myself attracted to the brand too for some of their stuff, especially when it comes to design and fit.

They have skinny fits for almost everything, like mens jeans, dress pants, sweat pants, etc., which I don't really find appealing, but slimmer fit tops, hoodies, jackets I do think looks really good, and would be really popular with the young generation of today who are really into fitness, and showing a bit of muscle definition. I find it really weird because tight fitting bottoms aren't hard to find here, but tighter fitting tops are, and it seems like some styles in NA fashion are like that too where skinny fit bottoms are paired with looser tops.

Currently I usually wear chinos and a button down or polo.  However,  I'd like to class it up a little more add I continue to move up.

The notes even state: feminine and other female indicating words. Now, in the same Le Pliage tab are the backpacks that have not notes about being marketed specifically towards any sex. On the website Le Pliage bags are actually a whole different tab than the men’s and women’s luxury items (they also have backpacks in the men’s luxury category at +1,000$ but the Le Pliage is only $125).

The only material that comes to mind is faux-leather, but as a non-native english speaker I am not sure whether that's a term for a specific set of materials, or a term for any material that tries to mimic leather (I am using the word in this sense). I want the smooth feel leather has, the water-repellent nature of the material and ideally, longevity.

I have had white faux-leather shoes before, but those cheap ones that last one season. I'd like to buy a quality pair of minimal white sneakers that are not low quality. It seems like most brands which make high quality shoes make only leather ones (since leather is a high quality material for shoes) and most faux-leather shoes are low quality, mall brands. These that seem to be durable and of good quality are then often ugly or definitely not what I have in mind, they usually make those coloured, weird lookinh shoes.

# Notes

* My donation pile was primarily Uniqlo tops, mostly due to the tops being too short for me and at questionable quality at times. I need to stop buying Uniqlo tops.
* All  Saints is for rail thin model boys, and I'm shaped like a snake who ate a beach ball. Probably not worth the premium price, even on sale.

However, most of the ones available fall into two categories:

- elegant, but not waterproof, thin and cold;

- boxy, with thick soles that look like Timberlands, which in my opinion clashes with the elegant.

- more rarely, Gore Tex Derby style shoes from e.g. Timberland ( I have a pair, they're great to wear but boy aren't they pretty to look at)


Are there really no boots out there that have slim, elegant lines, maybe a couple nice details (I've seen some with a brogue-like element), waterproofing and a bit of padding?


I had a pair of Chukka boots from Strellson which were perfect because they had everything, including a thin layer of wool-like padding. However they're too casual for a suit and they don't make them anymore.


To be sure that this is not a simple question: I am open to different style suggestions (slightly more casual/sportier but still defined would be acceptable) and looking for options I might have missed.

I don’t get to wear a suit often so admittedly Ive been having a lot of fun shopping for this suit and having it tailored, etc. as I’ve recently started paying attention to fashion a little bit more. I opted to go with a nice red and black floral bow tie for this event and I’m running in to some overthinking when it comes to selecting an overcoat. Because of the bow tie (which is an attention grabber in itself), does special consideration need to be had in looking at the collar area of an overcoat,? You don’t want anything to narrow or pinched at the neck, but to low and exposed makes the outfit appear unfitted and loose. Also I imagine you don’t want anything that is to flashy, or overly fashionable due to not wanting to over accessorize (bow tie and nice coat) and take away from the authenticity of the suit itself. I’m also going back and forth between a peacoat style or overcoat. The overcoat seems like it presents a nicer semi formal evening appearance, while the peacoat leans more casual, which puts me on the overcoat side of the fence.

Situation is that I for a long time had a nice pair of shoes (same as attached image) that I ""inherited"" after an uncle passed away suddenly. Thought they were pretty slick and only wore them a few times a year. 

A few weeks ago, one of my other pairs of shoes had a tear starting so took them to a local well-reviewed shop along with these for a clean/polish. Fast forward, after a few calls, turns out that the owner's son that I dropped them off with straight gave away my shoes - to an apparently random person in the store, on the basis of them pointing to my shoes and saying ""hey those are mine"". Supposedly this person wasn't a customer or anything because they had no information on them. I was to stunned by the stupidity at the time to really ask questions, end game was that my shoes are gone.

Dealing with the owner now, he has offered to pay or replace the shoes, but the problem is I didn't buy them and can't find anywhere online (or calling Men's Warehouse / JoS A Bank / etc, they don't carry that brand) &amp; frankly I don't want to settle for the $30 

So, my question being, is does anyone know where can I reliably obtain the new purchase price of those pairs of shoes? I was able to figure it out it was these because I still had the inner bag that contained them &amp; recognizing them

I hesitantly accepted but then they couldn't ship that one, either. Then they offered to either sell me a black case or keep my money for two months waiting on (maybe) getting a brown case, neither of which was a good option.

This year's coming to a close soon, so let's look back at this year and talk about how fashion has changed for us. Has your style or approach to fashion evolved since January? Maybe there were a few standout runway shows or lookbooks that have really stuck with you. What pieces did you buy that worked out really well? What didn't pan out? Any regrets, achievements, bad jokes that sum up the year for you? What about fashion in general? Any trends that have surprised you?

Share any pictures that show how fashion has changed for you: outfit pic, inspo pic, and anything else you might have saved. No promises I'll be any better about posting these next year, but fingers crossed.",[Weeklyish Fashion Discussion] What did this year in fashion look like for you?

- All listings **must** be posted from reputable platforms like Grailed, Ebay, Depop, Poshmark, etc. 

- All transactions are to be conducted through these sites. If you go offsite, you do so at your own risk.

- **All disputes should be handled through Grailed/Ebay/Paypal.**
__________________________________

A few tips if you are new to buying and selling on Grailed/Ebay, etc. 

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers. 

- Ask for measurements if there aren't any. Tag sizes vary wildly. 

If you want to do a trade: 

- Create a listing for each of your items, set them as the same price, then buy them from one another. This is the safest way to do trades, as you are still fully covered by PayPal protection.",Buy Sell Thread - December 02

187,malefashionadvice,"As part of a series of reviews I will be doing for the MFA community, I wanted to start off with the Taylor Stitch Democratic Chino's as I recently reviewed one of the co-founders of the company on my podcast. You can see the full post at [www.teshercohen.com](https://www.teshercohen.com).

## First Impressions:

Despite the brand being known for their shirting, my first purchase  from the company was their Democratic fit Chinos (straight fit). What  stands out most about the pants, is the simplicity in design and  construction. On the outside, there aren’t any fancy frills. What you  will find, is a map of San Francisco printed on the inside pockets which  adds an interesting contrast if you need to find your way around San  Francisco. Soft and well structured would be the best way to describe  these. They are on the more casual side and a better paired with a  t-shirt or un-tucked button down shirt. 

## Construction:

It’s clear that the team at Taylor Stitch dedicated a great deal of  time in putting together a pair of chino’s worth selling. From the brass  buttons to the custom YKK/Brass zipper and hardware, it’s clear that  the team at TS didn’t cut corners. The material its self isn’t  necessarily thick, and seems more suited for spring and summertime wear  as opposed to winter. That said, the construction looks clean and sturdy  enough to withstand whatever you throw at it. In terms of the overall  quality, the two pairs I ordered showed no sign of fraying or loose  threads which lends to the quality control.

## Fit:

Coming from someone who wears J. Crew, Bonobo’s, and Jomer’s, the fit  of the democratic chino’s are in line with the  J. Crew 770 broken and  the 770’s stretch chinos in terms of fabric and stretch to a lesser  degree. The fit its self is very comfortable and although considered a  straight fit, has a mild taper that similar to most modern fits. One  thing that should be noted is that the standard inseam is 36”. Depending  on your height and if you prefer to roll up your pants, this may be a  non-issue. If you happen to live near a TS store, they will happily hem  them for free and offer store credit if you provide a receipt from a  local tailor. 

In the blog post I provided a table illustrating a sizing comparison between the Democratic Chinos and the J.Crew 770’s as a guide.

## Conclusion:

The Taylor Stitch Democratic chinos are a very well rounded pair of  pants. Between the workmanship, minimalist design, and interesting  details, I would consider them to be worth the purchase. I have only had  them for a couple of weeks now, and the softness of the material in  conjunction with the slight stretch makes them comfortable to wear  throughout the day. As someone who prefers simplicity when it comes to  apparel, I’d line these a step up from J.Crew in terms of quality. If  you are in the market for a pair of quality chino’s that get the job  done, the Taylor Stitch Democratic chino’s are worth the purchase. I’d  call these pants, “The Reliable s”.

They must be getting their jeans from another country because its very poor these days.

I have scoured the Wiki's, but sadly cannot find anything similar (but lots of dead links).

For example, I see they'll have the number and name (i.e., 2560 Wyndham) and in the description, they'll have Line 5 (apparently line 4 was the 40mm..) - is there any way for me to get to what the actual product is (or if there is a thread/ etc somewhere that someone has listed this out in more detail)?

Where it gets interesting is actually trying to copy some of these looks.   
Where the do I find a top like the starter one, and what is it even called? A quarter button up? They called it a three quarter sleeve polo, but no way in hell!

The other thing I want is that backpack. I didn't pay a single bit of attention to it in the trailers, but when you play and see it on the characters back, it stands out so much because it's not the usual kids backpack you're used to the characters having. It looks like an all leather bag that has straps that allow it to function like a backpack? No idea where to find something like that, but I want one!",Analyzing Pokémon Fashion and How to Copy It.

312,malefashionadvice,"I never wanted to get into fashion. It started because I was bullied for the way I dress in grade 9. Now this is all I have become. 

I dress like shit, and it's not hard to tell. But that doesn't matter because I now live off of validation from other people. When someone says they like my shoes, it gives me energy. When someone asks something about my clothes and I get to tell them about it, it gives me energy. I have become dependent on this energy, and it's the only thing that keeps me going. This is a problem.

I have become nothing more than the clothes I wear. ""I shop therefore I am."" I define myself based on what I wear and I can't helo but imagine others do as well.

I appreciate art. What I do not appreciate is paying over $500 for a pair of shoes. I can't help but think that there is no difference in wearing a pair of converse VS wearing a pair of geobaskets. They both serve the same function. Yes, of course the geos are much higher quality, and they look way nicer, but that shouldn't matter. I should have to care about having nice shoes. I shouldn't feel good about owning nice shoes. I should feel good about myself.

I think all of this stems from pressure to be accepted. I am even guilty of this. I have forced my interests into some of my friends. The thing with nice clothes is that not just one person can have it; as soon as people notice you dress nice, they will want to dress nice themselves and so on. I feel awful for doing this, I see how it starts to consume them.

I want to get rid of it all. I want to burn it all. Every single one of my shoes tops and pants, gone. I want people to see me. I want to see myself too.

I just needed to share this. I feel like this is the only place to post this. I really need some guidance.",This has become a problem.

I've been trying to decide between several leather jackets. They aren't significantly different in style, but the leather itself varies. I literally know nothing about leather, so I am hoping someone here can walk me through the differences. It's hard to explain why, but I basically have to get some leather attire with up to $350 to spend max. I

I actually really like Bomber jackets, but I am on the taller side with a longer torso, so I don't think any Bomber style jacket would go down far enough. I feel like that's just how those jackets are, but by all means if there is a place where you can get medium-tall Bombers let me know!

Anyways, these still have that nice minimalist style that I am looking for, so they work just as well. These are from [Caine's Leather](https://www.caineleather.co.uk/), which I was told was a good starting point from the [Leather Jacket Buying Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8mzjpd/leather_jackets_a_lengthy_buying_guide_v20/). Here are the jackets I am considering:

[#1 ultra soft sheep](https://www.caineleather.co.uk/Mens-Leather-Jacket-in-Black-Leverkusen.html)

[#2 sheep analine](https://www.caineleather.co.uk/Mens-Leather-Jacket-in-Black-Leverkusen.html)

[#3 sheep nappa](https://www.caineleather.co.uk/Mens-Leather-Jacket-in-Black-Leverkusen.html)

[#4 cow leather](https://www.caineleather.co.uk/Mens-Cow-Leather-Jacket-in-Black-Ashreigny.html)

I can't really tell any meaningful difference in #1-3, but I know they are supposed to be lighter and softer then #4. But #4 is probably the nicest quality, right?

The other place mentioned in the guide is [Wilson's Leather](https://www.wilsonsleather.com/category/mens/jackets-all.do), and they seem to have quite the same going on so maybe I can get something higher quality even in that price range?

I care about my clothing and am very conscious of my style but am also hyper aware of the damage the fashion industry does to the environment.

395,malefashionadvice,"I'm 24... and first suit I ever had was for prom... of course that suit doesn't fit no more and actually never fitted. Typical off the rack suit at LeChateau and didn't know that suit buying was more complex, it isn't just shopping around like clothes. Now, that I know more about suits and the process... I am interested in buying my first suit just to have in case. No typical event scheduled but just to have one in case that something does arise. My budget is around $800CAD and was thinking of Suit Supply (store in my city). Also, 100% getting it tailored. Even shopping shirts or hoodies have been not the easiest sometimes. I have broad shoulders and somewhat of a narrow waist. While sometimes the shoulders fit fine, I float in the shirt or the shirt fits fine around my waist, I'm all tight on the shoulders. So, tailoring is a must. But, my main dilemna is colour. 

Before you guys roast me... gray, charcoal suits... don't hate it but definitely don't love them. A lot of people love them but I just don't find ""gray"" as nice. I'm contemplating on a classic black suit or a navy suit. I'm quite positive that navy is going to win hands down haha. But, black suit is classic for me... and in my opinion can be for every occasion... I mean some might disagree but changing the dress shirt or tie (colours, patterns) can change the ""vibe"" of a black suit. As for the navy, I've always loved navy... and especially the navy suit with burgundy tie combination. For now typical plain black or navy suit is what I'm looking for. Later on, might have a look at those checkered suits. I've been checking suits out for months and I seem addicted to them lol... anyways...

This suit will be sitting in my closet most likely but knowing I got one sitting there is one less thing to worry about. If time goes by then I might purchase another one. So, any opinions on which is a safer option ? I know it's my preference but would like to know others opinion who are more experienced or have been in similar situations.",First Suit Buying ?!

It's cold here in Canada, and will be for a while, so I'm thinking of spending some cash on a couple fall/winter outfits that I like (that way I can start rotating them) and worry about the summer later. I'm not super into fashion though and it's hard to find an outfit that ""suits me"". 

I purchased [this sweater](https://boathousestores.com/collections/sale-mens-clothing?_=pf&amp;pf_v_brands=BJÖRGVIN) last week in olive. I'm thinking of picking up another in grey, and maybe brown as well. That would cover all my sweater needs. Then I could pick up a simple jacket that would layer well with the sweater.

For pants, I normally wear black Levi 510s. I'm not sure what else I could wear, maybe chinos (I think that's what the sweater model is wearing haha). 

For shoes, I normally wear all white Ultra Boosts, Converse, or CDBs.

It's strange going out and noticing how many men don't bother tucking their dress shirts in, I get it and I understand it but I see so many guys who would look so much more presentable if they didn't gloss over it. It just kinda looks sloppy, especially when the shirt has noticeable tails.

8,malefashionadvice,"Lately I have been looking into getting a long coat, but I just cannot make my mind up on this decision: single or double breasted?

In general I wear knitwear or sweaters this season, with some black chinos/jeans or dark blue jeans.

In my own research I saw that double-breasted is more formal, for business situation's (and it's a lot of fabric) and single-breasted is more adaptive and can be used for formal and informal.

I'm a university student that prefers to wear business casual. So I feel like I should take the single breasted one since it's a safe bet (the coat is also expensive), but the double breasted one is very popular so maybe I'm being scared for nothing.

TL;DR Should I get the safe road and get the single coat, or be a bit more ""daring"" and pick double breasted?","Buying my first long coat, single or double breasted?"
9,malefashionadvice,"So, I'll start off by saying some basic info about myself. I'm a 17 year old guy living in a fairly rural area of New England in the USA. I'm 5' 10"" and around 145 lbs, so I'm fairly thin, but I'm also tall with really long legs which makes finding pants that fit right very tough.

Pretty much forever, my everyday clothing has been loose-fitting, cheaper clothing. I come from a relatively low-income middle-class family, so I learned quickly to wear what I had and not to complain too much about it. My parents bought what they could afford for me to wear, and I wore it. But, I never really liked wearing that baggy, inexpensive stuff. Sure, I enjoyed wearing a t-shirt from a concert or of a band I liked, but that was mostly for the graphics and showing off my love of music and such. I never actually liked wearing t-shirts and hoodies and sweatshirts and the like. I always liked wearing nice clothes, even if it was also fairly cheap. I lived for my chorus concerts when I got to wear my black dress slacks, my nice dress shirts, and a tie (or better yet -- a bow tie). And it wasn't until the end of my junior year of high school that I really got into the art of dressing nicer.

Last year, (my junior year) as junior prom approached, I started doing a lot of research into suits and the like. My parents decided that my birthday gift would be getting me a custom tailored suit, mostly so I had something to wear to prom. And I got one. The process of getting it measured and cut and finally trying it on fully fitted for the first time was one of the greatest experiences of my whole life. 

I have some fairly bad body image issues, despite the fact that I'm at least relatively attractive. The only time I don't really feel crappy about how I look is when I'm ""dressed up"".

So, I think that all the background is now out of the way. On to the actual meat of my question/issue. I really want to be able to dress ""nice"" every single day, i.e. collared shirt, any kind of pants really, maybe a sport coat, etc. But, I have too main issues with this. The first is simply a matter of environment. At my high school, almost nobody dresses like that. Everybody dresses really casual. So it tends to look weird when someone dresses nice at school. Now, I'm all for being unique and even a bit eccentric, but I also don't want to come off as haughty at all. The second issue is money. I and my family do not really have the extra money to spend on nice clothes. My mom suggested that I try shopping at vintage stores, but there's really none around me. I could try like thrift stores and Goodwill and stuff, but I'm not sure they'd have what I'm looking for.

If any of you on here could give me any advice for where to find nice, sort of older styled clothes for not a crazy amount of money, I would really really appreciate it. Sorry if this post is too personal. I just really need some help here and I didn't know where else to ask. Thank you all in advance!",I'd really appreciate some help with the way I dress and look.
10,malefashionadvice,"I don't know much about dressing. I had measured myself and found my inseam is about 26.75 inches from bottom of crotch to ankle. My waist is 27.5 inches. I'm looking to spend less than $40, preferrably less than $35.

I've never really bought my clothes(my mom used to do that), so I'm not familiar with this stuff much.

I searched ""slacks"" on Amazon and saw this item come up first: Amazon Essentials Men's Slim-Fit Wrinkle-Resistant Flat-Front Chino Pant. I'm not really understanding the sizes though. Should I go with the 28Wx28L size? That's the closest there seems to be for my size in the product.

Also is the L for length of the whole pants or inseam? I had read some web pages on measuring myself for pants and I was told I only needed the inseam and waist measurements to get pants.","Newbie here, what pants should I buy for an interview?"

I'll search through fashion articles and such on the net, and even if there's pictures of 30 different styles, I literally cannot tell the difference between that, and the T-shirt+cardigan that I'm wearing now. I also can't tell what colors match me best: I can try on every flavor of the rainbow in bright and pastel colors, and *they all look the same to me.* Outfits that people compliment me on, I just don't see what makes them complimentary. In some cases I even think they look bad on me, yet everyone thinks they look good on me. It's weird. 

This also gets a little complicated in winter since I'm a practical person who goes for functional clothing. I'm likely to wear a CWU-45P because it's windproof, water resistant, and warm. People are likely to say ""Well you don't look *terrible* but you could wear something much better, like a pea coat.""

18,malefashionadvice,"Heya guys,

I've always had an enormous passion for fragrances and I've always been the guy that people say that 'smells really good all the time'. Even tho I've owned dozens of different fragrances across the years only now I really started to develop my deep interest for them and actually understanding each scent, when they're meant to use and identifying what each cologne contains. I guess that until now I've been relatively lucky to chose the right ones for the right occasions or maybe I have a hidden superpower when it comes to my flair.

Anyways, I'd like to ask you guys in which occasions you'd use the following fragrances and preferably if you could include an explanation why it'd help my research even more as well as my understanding of the scents. I have my own opinions but I figure it'd be better if I don't share them yet to avoid holding back your imagination ;)

\- Carolina Herrera | Men Privé

Basically like I said, I'm curious how some people seem to have like an endless wardrobe, even though it's probably less than that.

I was wondering if hes selling firsts or seconds, and if it's something he would divulge, as if they are mostly seconds I'd rather just buy seconds directly from AE. 

Alternatively, does anyone in Canada know where to get good dress shoes for a fair price other than from online vendors? My budget is about $400 Canadian all in, and I know with Black Friday around the corner there are some deals to be had. 

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated!","Allen Edmonds, Toronto"

*^(First of all tell me if I should post this in the daily question thread and I'll delete.)*

Long time lurker, I am now in need of help. I am coming back home (France) next week from a 10 months long trip where I lost 20kg. I'm now a 1,76m / 70kg guy. Most of my clothes at home won't be quite fit, even more cause before being chubby, I liked my clothes larger than needed.

How do I approach this ? I will have to buy basic stuff, but also things that I'll like... I don't know how to proceed, is there a guide for this kind of situation ?

Now I like my body (not before) hence I intend to take more interest in what I'm wearing outside of work (I do manual work so now clothes changing to do there). I plan on wearing more classy clothes, I was more into street/work wear before.

Any input would be appreciated ! Thanks a lot !",Wardrobe redo

1) Rockport Ellingwood Black Cap-Toe Oxford
2) Rockport Dustyn Chukka Brown
3) CK slim Black Slacks 
4) 2x Old Navy Tan Chinos
5) Old Navy Black Chinos
6) Old Navy Brown Chinos
7) Express Solid White Dress Shirt
8) Exp Casual Short Sleeve Button-down Blue with small design

Aside from these clothing, I own many T-shirts and shorts and sweatpants from school, events, and casual/comfort wear, that I feel is definitely not appropriate for office wear. Any advice would help. Would love to incorporate some polos or more casual button-down.

I need help in decide a Navy Sports Coat to buy for an upcoming business trip. This is to pair with light blue / white OCBDs, Khaki/Grey chinos, and Dark Brown chukkas. I am wondering which ones of these jacket would be the best for the outfit I have planned and for a business setting? Would these be considered to preppy?

My preference so far is the BB3 Wool Blend Twill, but not sure if that coat is Navy enough for my purposes or if the Wool/Twill blend is way too casual. This is my first time buying a sportscoat, and I don't imagine I need to be wearing a suit, but should still dress somewhat nicer.

Also if anyone has any advice on how how these Brooks Brothers Red Fleece jackets fit compared to Jos A Bank, I would love to hear your input.  At Jos A Bank, I am a 40R Tailored Fit. Not sure how that will translate over to Brooks Brothers.

145,malefashionadvice,"My family is sort of anti-fashion, or at least the guys were. Almost every dude in my family has had long, unkempt hair at some point (including me) and has usually dressed like they just dgaf (oversized shirts and pants). I used to see fashion as something that sellouts did. And even when I first started paying attention to how I dressed, I wouldn’t go all out. I would just wear shit I thought was cool sometimes but I would still dress very casual.

This year I started really paying attention to how I look. I bought clothes that actually fit, I started paying attention to color coordination, I got a proper haircut (and even dyed it) and I started putting together whole outfits instead of just wearing a cool shirt or something every now and then. I like it but I sometimes feel like a fraud when I’m around dudes who dress like I used to. And I still have a dgaf type attitude which I think confuses people. It’s not even like I follow trends. I make a conscious effort to dress in my own way and wear unique shit/colors. But I just feel so put together and sometimes I just wanna throw it all away and go back to wearing baggy hoodies and having one pair of shoes and pants.

Most of the time, I know this is bullshit, but sometimes I really feel like I have just sold-out and that the people I used to be like think I’m a sellout. But I’m also just not the same as I used to be either. I went through a bunch of horrible shit and it completely changed me as a person. I still have those roots though, and probably feel most comfortable around the slacker type of people (even though I’m not a slacker anymore). So yea, I dunno why I’m writing this, I guess I’m wondering if anyone else went through this and if it got better after a while?",I sometimes feel like a fraud when I dress nice

Since graduating into adulthood I have been buying my dress clothes at brooks brothers.  I have found now after purchasing a several different jackets ( at different locations) that the associates try size me differently each time. 

I have established that my shoulders can accommodate a 36 or a 38 in their Regent cut, or a 38 in their Milano. I am approximately 5' 7"" and have been advised every time at brooks brothers to purchase a short jacket. 

I recently went to a tailor outside of the store and was told that the sleeves were too short on the purple jacket (picture attached below) and that it could not be let out anymore.  I have been trying to scout online to determine the appropriate sleeve length, but am finding conflicting suggestions.

I have included pictures below of 3 jackets I own from brooks brothers (grey - 38s regent, purple 38s milano, and brown 36s regent). If anyone could tell me if the sleeves are appropriate on any of these jackets I would greatly appreciate it.

I hesitated, as it was on the way north end of what I was expecting to spend. I was assured though it is as warm and dry as a relatively slim-fitting coat can be.

Having received and utilized it now, I can say I'm pretty happy with it. It's warmer than it appears, and doesn't require much layering. I was also a little nervous that it might be a little short and bomber-like, but it's a good length. Admittedly it fits in more with the Carhartts of the world than something fancier, but it walks a fine line, and unless you're wearing a suit, it's dressy enough.

209,malefashionadvice,"Please excuse my terrible writing.

There's been more and more media coverage and posts on the topic of fashion sustainability, and i've becoming increasingly more interested in educating myself on the issue and I hope to use it as one of the driving force for my future shopping decisions.

So here's my 2c. I think in the coming years consuming fast fashion at the rate we are will become a major issue. Recycling clothing is mostly a marketing gimmick, most of the donated old clothes still ends up in landfill or the furnace. Major brands are hiding the facts deep in their reports and are intentionally making it hard for the consumers to understand just how damaging it is to the environment.

The Patriot Act did an episode (The Ugly truth of Fast Fashion) on the topic recently and I think it's a great way for someone to get into the issue.

Searching the subreddit for ""sustainability"", I see there have been a few posts about brands and their commitment to be ""green"" or how fast fashion brands are tricking the consumer with their vague ""green"" marketing.. [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/cv67x0/the_biggest_names_in_fashion_commit_to_be_more/) [\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/czysnl/hm_zara_and_other_fashion_brands_are_tricking/)

From a quick Google session, it seems like there are ways for someone to quantifiability calculate the environmental consumption and footprint of a piece of garment. Ie using Higg MSI one can calculate based on the material used to make the clothes (wool, cotton, polyester etc). But this is a tedious process and mostly developed for academia use and not meant for a consumer to quickly reference when they're doing their shopping.

My question for the community is, what are some way you decide on if a brand of a piece of clothing is produced sustainably? Out side of the branded bullsh*t like ""[H&amp;M conscious](https://about.hm.com/content/dam/hmgroup/groupsite/documents/masterlanguage/CSR/reports/2018_Sustainability_report/HM_Group_SustainabilityReport_2018_%20FullReport.pdf)"" line and the Zara equivalent? I know the community loves Uniqlo, how are they being sustainable? How do we truly define the term and use it to calculate the environment impact of a piece of clothing we want to purchase?

For Sellers: 

- Always make sure that you are eligible for PayPal seller protection - ship only to verified addresses, require a signature, and update the tracking information **on the PayPal website** instead of just messaging it to the person. 

- Take good pictures! Bring the item outside so that people can really get a good look at it. 

- Provide measurements. If you need a good guide on how to take them, look [here](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/how-we-measure). 

- Consider providing a discount for MFA members! 

For Buyers: 

- If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Check a user's feedback before you buy. 

- Don't go offsite. Because I know some of you will anyway, make sure you still use PayPal. Don't send someone money through PayPal ""Friends and Family"", make sure you are ""Paying for Goods and Services"".

- If you make an offer, pay it. No one likes flakers.

247,malefashionadvice,"# Full disclosure

# these are individual opinions in my experience, experiences will be differ by store locations and staffs, opinions are absolutely not fact or truth that applies to all stores or current time frame, I do not guarantee you will experience the same since it was written only by my past personal experiences with news provided by my friend have recently worked with them.

# However items they carry are all the same nationwide and it was proven several times in this sub that they are terrible in any aspects, I only intend to address why it sucks in depth and additionally sharing my personal complaints and whining which are free to judge.

# 

Hey y'all.

Let me introduce myself, I have worked at Men's Wearhouse(southwest suburban location) in the past as a salesperson as my first job in my young age, I am very fascinated by history of clothing, I went through owning bunch of clutters including full and half canvased, fused suits, ethic culture-ish clothing, frock coats and hats as my hobby, I never purchased anything from Men's Wearhouse in my life even with the employee discounts because it gravely sucked compare to what I could find elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

My experience was far from pleasant, both as a customer and an employee. It was clear that company does not appreciate how much people are fascinated about men's wear, all I could feel was usual money grabbing company.

And I noticed on this subreddit that there are still some people deciding between Men's Wearhouse and other brands, here are some tip for you, short answer is don't shop if you are looking for something specific but there are some exceptions, here we go.

&amp;#x200B;

**Before I go even farther, let me explain the brands they carry first, after all this is a shopping guide.**

Pronto Umo: Their in house brand, infamous boxy cut fused suits, runs around $250 and you end up paying for alterations like half or quarter of that prices most of the time.

Egara: $300 50% polyester/rayon blend fused suits, wool is not in their book, targeted poor prom/homecoming kids and these are the few slim fit suits they carry. 

Joseph Abboud: half canvased Italian fabric suits, some of them are made in US and that's it.

Joe: Joseph Abboud owned brand, comes from India/Vietnam/Indonesia/China etc.., they pull off overpriced new products a lot and never mentions they are fused or canvased.

Calvin Klein: Fused $700 suits, fuck em.

Keneath Cole: Personally the worst brand, most overpriced compare to quality, $800 made in China half canvased suits.

# 1. Overall shopping quality

**Fused or Half canvased suits for full canvased price.**

Most outrageous part, they sell Calvin Klein fused suit for $700 and half canvased made in USA suit for $900 while there are no full canvased option at all and only focus on advertising that they are Italian fabric with high thread counts.

I am not advertising but you can buy the exact same fabric with way better price and cut from ""Lanieri"", This is why I ended up never buying from Men's Wearhouse even with the 60%\~70% employ discounts(excludes custom all the time lol) because it's not worth it compared to the other competitors, also there were a few times Made in USA suits came all messed up(wrong cut, stains, shitty stitches etc.) and had to reorder for the customer, I do not trust the quality and most of all it also charges you extra $50 for just having button holes on the sleeves which are free when it comes to even for Chinese companies such as Tailor4less(now it's renamed Hockerty or whatever), also most of the time nobody even mention that to the customers that this option exists, I asked why that doesn't need to be mentioned, the answer I got was ""nobody does it."".

This is how it all comes to the fact that there is also major issue with the staffs quality, they don't let you know the option, they only mention you the weird options you don't need such as permanent creases rather then double breasted option or peaked lapels, all those things that help express your self. Those are all waste of time mentioning for them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Staff's lack of basic knowledge of suits and lack of training material.**

The most disappointing part for me, my boss don't even know what the hell is goodyear welted shoes, bespoke, even the difference between fused and canvased.

You will think what makes Men's wearhouse employees qualified for the job if they don't know anything about how the items are being made, the answer was in the job training, they make you watch bunch of videos and none of them was about introducing knowledge about products itself but telling you what you have to do for selling more stuffs to customers. There are like 5 videos, they are simply about how to control customers soon as they walk in on each occasions, you are not allowed to let customers do their own things, you greet them, ask what they are looking for, get their size, pull out stuff for them, make them wear that, if the customer is trying the pants on you are required to know their shoe size and make them try the shoe on for ""fitting purposes"" and eventually make them buy the shoes, if they are not looking for a suit jacket, offer them to try on the jacket when they are by the mirror, ask them ""Do me a favor try this sports coat on, this will look good with (whatever the hell) you are wearing"", get them to the table show them bunch of non-iron dress shirts with some random ties, tell them these shirts and ties would look good on your occasion with mentioning shirts and ties are interchangeable or versatile so you have to buy all of them and tell them these are investments on your wardrobes along with mentioning you have to buy $30 suit hanger, $40 garment bag to keep your clothes safe.

Even if customer says they don't wear ties you have to show them ties, you have to put at least one jacket on the table and slap them with the shirts and tie then show them, letting customers go through the rack and choose by themselves, or else managers are going to bitch at you for not following the standards. This comes to the conclusion that they don't give a shit about what customers think or plan, no respect towards the customers not letting them explore by themselves.

Working with Men's Wearhouse, You will just end up annoying the hell out of customers; or if you are lucky, you will run across a mindless man(usually boomers 99%) who buys everything you suggests, which is not likely to happen, and even if it occurs, those people have usually already bought a lot of stuff from other salesperson from the store and came looking for that person to buy more stuffs so you have to hand them over to that other salesperson or somebody will get mad lol.

&amp;#x200B;

It is extremely disturbing that they do not invest on employees knowledge base at all, just expect them to go with robotic suggestion with outdated mediocre selection and label them as ""style experts"".

&amp;#x200B;

**They are only interested in selling you random overpriced shit and nothing else.**

You walk in, they would try hard to ask you start with how are you doing, what's the occasion, when do you need clothes, blahbi da and your budget is never their consideration(it's forbidden to ask). Unless if you need suit asap, they will try to hook you up with custom tailored which are high commission, most of the people comes to Men's Wearhouse actually need it done in a week, rack is full of Calvin Klein and Pronto Umo, options are pretty much either $700 slim fit fused suit or $250 boxy cut fused suit you won't enjoy wearing. After that they will shamelessly proceed to ask you to come over to the table full of shirts,ties,suit hangers,belts,socks..etc, and you need $30 suit hanger that looks similar to the hanger they give you for free at Nordstrom to keep whatever suit they sold to you safe from moth and moisture, start offering you all the thing, you would just say ""I'm good no thanks"", if it's management person if you are talking to, they will relentlessly offer you 30% or whatever discounts they are allowed to throw, because they get higher commission when selling the other clutters along with a jacket. If you meet a nice person just let you go without saying anything you will probably won't see him next time because they fire people don't sell enough suit packages.

At this point, their business idea has been started with treating customers dumb asses can't feed ideas themselves, and you might ask you will be fine because you know what you are doing and gonna look for some custom tailored US made suits only. I'm sorry to disappoint you, they already semi got you at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Good for nothing no option custom tailoring.**

But hey, Made in USA suits, can't be so bad, can it?, I get to look at the fabrics with my own eyes and get to pick them, sounds actually better than buying on internet right?.

Well, this is where the disaster happens, if it's in person, and if you ever bought bespoke suit or whatever in person custom tailored purchase from anywhere, you would be familiar with ""fitting process"" with skeleton, they don't have it.

They measure you and you will be asked to wear something off the rack for fitting and after that you just wait until the all finished suit comes to the store. The major problem here is that without the actual fitting process it will be same experience as buying off from internet and even some of the internet tailors send you unfinished skeleton to try on, also if you have special body type, it's impossible to do fitting off the rack and end up the guy measures you just have to guess your fit and put the order in, with mentioning when it comes in alterations going to be free for custom order and if you don't like it they will remake it for free, this is resulted from too many custom orders messed up with guessing works, so they have to keep try guessing until it fits you without getting you mad. Most of the time they will order pants in bigger size and just alter it to avoid reorder, there's no point doing this in person if the custom tailoring goes on like this.

&amp;#x200B;

If I may add, this is also common problem in some other similar brands(Indochino is the perfect example) with actual stores, lot of experienced guess work is required to fit right without fitting process and even with the experiences it's hard to get it right only with numbers, this is likely resulted by lack of experienced tailors/haberdashers compare to market demand. Old school tailors takes their time to perform the art of tailoring, not rushed by ""I need suit today"" customers who comes to the store for the last minute shopping.

&amp;#x200B;

OK but let's say you are not that much picky and enough with choosing fabrics and designs you like. As I mentioned, you have to pay for sleeve button holes, not only that you have to pay more for french cuff shirts, pay for slanted pocket, ticket pocket, all that details they do for free at other brands. You're gonna end up paying even more for what you want, and guess what, you don't get to choose what kind of buttons would you like or how many buttons would you like on your sleeves, there's no option but plastic buttons. Anyway they won't even mention the options unless you ask them to look it up. In a word, they just expect you to get 2 button single breasted with fake sleeve buttons in default just like off the rack, then what's the meaning of custom tailoring at this point?, with paying more then $900.

&amp;#x200B;

**New products nobody ever asked for.**

I'm going to cut to the chase on this one, they came out with NHL, NFL linings, who the hell wants sports team logo printed everywhere on the lining?, and they came out with this rather than improving actual selection. New suit line up?, they came out with recycled polyester suits with advertising they used plastic bottle polyester blended with ""Animal cruelty free Organic wool"" they ask $600 for it, since when did wool wasn't organic and harms the sheep?.

Plastic bottle suits and pretending to be a good sustainable company(but actually not, they individually wrap everything in plastic on every shipments.), I would say how dare you, this is truly mentioning on r/Anticonsumption worthy as well.

They are clearly mocking the customers stupidity, beyond that, they just want to sell more and more quantity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Repetitive BOGO sale every other week.**

Obviously prices are too high, giving discounts on single item is rare, what they full off is buy one get one free. Otherwise buy one get one half off is always going, it's always half assed deal in nutshell. Their single item prices are too high so giving away another one can be still a lot of profit so just selling more is their top priority, as well as clearing all the items off before it gets to clearance while tricking customers they got a good deal.

This is pretty common in any brick and mortar style stores, there's actually nothing major wrong with this except it encourages buying things you don't need, but I see worth mentioning because they do same sale over and over hella lot in short period of time because nobody comes to the store so they can attract people and start shilling.

&amp;#x200B;

**Outdated website, neglected shipping issues.**

Website is a complete disaster, it's hard to navigate, find, can't look up what custom tailoring option's available only tells you to come to the store to find out, runs different promotion with the actual store that often ends up customers get confused when they try to buy at store after looking at online shop, as if it runs like a complete different shop with promotion wise. And sometimes you can find something not listed on online in the store or vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

It is worth mentioning that wrong color or wrong size comes in often, lot of customers actually come to the store to get item exchanged with what they ordered online. This is because ordered items comes from the each individual store locations not distribution hub, so store workers have to handle them find and shipping them out, not only they are on their own with finding item, print out the shipping label, pack them, and there are no measure making sure they are shipping the correct items or sometimes ordered items actually not in the store, results waste time finding them and hand the order over to the other store that system shows ordered items are available, but they might not have it either because they don't give a shit maintaining inventory system most of the time.

# 2. What the hell should I do if I end up shopping at Men's Wearhouse?

Don't get me wrong, even though it might be rare, there are some actually good clearance deals which they gave up selling on profitable prices, but you have to find out by yourself going through the rack, do not ask them to pull deals out for you, the only reason for you to talk to anybody there is ordering the clearance item in your size when it's not your size. The main goal is making sure they don't bother you until you find the sweet deal rather than what they suggests.

Most of the time if you find something awesome in dirt cheap prices, that's likely to be the only one left in the whole store nationwide, if it's your size I would say go for it or ask if there are any other available on other store to order for you.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](b3ji4uo15s041 ""They sure did gave up on this one :p"")

**Of course you can just simply say you are just browsing and kill some time. In my experience, soon as you go through the rack and check out some deals you spotted. For them, it's showing signals that you are interested in shopping, they will ask you what are you shopping for and try to pull out random stuff so they can hop you into their ""railroaded"" shopping experiences.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Bring a friend, make them go through the rack/items for you.**

If you are alone, they will pull random craps out with high commission without letting you go through by yourself at first, you will be just offered to try random things. But if you bring anybody just like buying a car from craigslists, they will have harder time controlling your shopping experience while your friend go through items for you by your actual needs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Be honest, tell them you are on ridiculously low budget in specific prices.**

You walk in, they say hi and ask usual interrogation questions but your budget, tell them you are looking for a cheap suit less than $200, finding a suit priced less than $200 is very rare(duh.) unless if it's clearance like above and even harder finding something that fits you. Literally they won't bother talking to you or going through hassle finding deal you want because usually it's waste of time for them, they would back off clean just like the people trying to sell you CDs at Hollywood.

&amp;#x200B;

**Be creative, or whatever.**

You can just full on ignore them anyway if you can deal with it, you can pretend you only speak Spanish, ask if they carry what they don't carry, possibility is endless. **just make sure don't harass their minimum wage salesperson..**

&amp;#x200B;

These are so far about the quality breakdown I have observed, if you are only interested in reading about why not to go or go, that's all the information I can give for you, next articles going to be about the brief work experience that are not relevant about male fashion topic but I just want to tell you that working with this company sucks for people who are fascinated about menswear either.

# 3. Work experience

**High pressure, low rewards.**

It's very easy to get hired and fired, you have to sell those good ole Men's wearhouse suits over and over everyday, you have to keep bothering customers getting into more junks they never thought about, you have to compete with other people including your management staffs, customers were limited because they'd rather shop at other places, if you are not selling enough they will pressure you, no matter what if your sale is low, blame is on you.

**How am I suppose to sell anything if nobody comes to the store?, and taking part of selling the worst suits available in the market?, I was already sacrificing my sanity(needless to say I did not last long time with this company).**

&amp;#x200B;

![img](p1o6l3054s041 ""From their hiring website, They are running low on salesperson because they've been keep firing people off."")

&amp;#x200B;

This encourages salesperson desperately getting into your businesses, as well as keep suggesting something you never asked for, what made men's wearhouse infamous.

In the end, it's just another minimum wage job not worth putting all your energies in. (yet I'm putting some energy in this post lol)

And I have to say this, my store was understaffed for maintenance and overstaffed for the amount of customers comes in a day, often salesperson had to clean and reorganize the messes during the operation hours, can't deal with the sale at the same time and losing your customers to the other staffs even if my turn to greet incoming customers(if there are any at all). Leads to lower sale stats of course.

&amp;#x200B;

**Nepotism.**

In my case, majority of store staff was related family or their kid's high school friends working there.

I even saw one of them getting hired without proper interview unlike I did before, one of their kid's friend comes in for interview without even wearing any business related attires, interview was short and told them they are hired right after the interview. Me on the other hand I worn full suit on the interview and answered bunch of questions about ""teamwork"" and had to wait for a week to hear from them.

Eventually I was the only one not related in anyway, it was discouraging work environment and HR department or corporate did not give a shit, it is obvious they only care about sale numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rules for thee but not for me dress codes.**

Dress codes prohibits non religious headwear and wear a tie all the time, yet one of the store management staff wore beret all the time without tie and shirt unbuttoned, one day I worn a pork pie hat which was actually from 19th century, once belonged to my grandfather.

Of course I had to take that off.

Nobody even cared to wear a suit jacket, just a shirt and a tie. I actually give thoughts on my outfits which made me the only person wearing jackets all the time in this work place, only customers appreciated it.

&amp;#x200B;

# So what's the conclusion?

Men's Wearhouse is an another boomer generation company living in the past PERIOD

&amp;#x200B;

AND Thank you for reading my lowlife crap, I sincerely hope if anybody planing to buy anything from there for either sale or standard prices this article would give them second thought, only buy what they gave up on selling.

260,malefashionadvice,"Christmas party for my work in the ballroom of a nice hotel. It will be an evening event which obviously means evening attire and I'm planning on dressing up for that. I don't own a suit at the moment so working with what I have... Black captoe oxfords (meermin) and whatever shit I buy on Black Friday. I work near Spier &amp; Mackay and Suit Supply so have no issue trying on and dealing with logistics (returns, exchanges, in-house tailoring?)though I'm not looking to drop a ton of $$$ on stuff that I might not get a ton of mileage on (i.e. $65 USD on a Van Gogh Starry Night pocket square or $55 USD on a Brooks Brothers Christmas Carolers pocket square). I'm currently looking to purchase whatever I need for the Christmas Party on Black Friday. Currently, what I'm thinking of is to acquire a Navy/Midnight blue blazer (maybe with a texture like Herringbone?), a white dress shirt and charcoal/black Chinos (thinking from BR or S&amp;M). And I'll pair that with my black oxfords. 

So based on that I've got a couple questions...

As mentioned, the 3 brands I've really been considering is BR, S&amp;M and SS. All 3 of which are extremely accessible from downtown Toronto. Is S&amp;M better value for a Canadian who can physically show up at their store (i.e. none of their logistics)? I've never been to SS or S&amp;M but I have a fairly athletic build due to spending too much time in the gym (likely 8'' drop or more) so prefer slimmer fits. I'm looking for value but also would prefer to spend a bit less if possible... I know S&amp;M will have some black friday sales based on what I've seen thus far but I'm hesitant to buy online until I try some S&amp;M stuff at their physical location. Should I look at BR Chinos/Blazer/dress shirts with the current deal ($80 for $100 gift card via Ebay + 60%)? 

Secondly, how do I add that bit of personal flair to my outfit? My neck is a bit too thick for my current ""dress shirts"" so a tie/bowtie might be a bit difficult for me unless I buy a dress shirt that fits around the neck. I'm planning on leaving the top button undone anyway so it's likely no big deal. I've considered a few things... First was a white dinner jacket/blazer (which I was informed would be inappropriate for the occasion), second was maybe a mistletoe boutonniere though I'm unsure how I would go about acquiring one, and third I was thinking a really fun pocket square like the Kent Wang one's which I'm crushing on hard (https://i.imgur.com/GOf5ddf.jpg) but can't justify dropping $65 USD with no guarantee that it'll even come in time. Any recommendations on adding that little bit of flair (and I guess a conversation starter as well) to my outfit?","What to wear for Christmas Party and add a bit of personal ""flair""?"

267,malefashionadvice,[removed],"Found at a thrift store, too small for me, but I really want to get one in my size"
268,malefashionadvice," Hi guys

A couple months ago I got a really nice pair of high top converse x tom and jerrys, as I absolutely loved the nostalgia. Loved those suckers and wore them day in and day out since, well today. The thing is, I wear them for everything, and I wear all my shoes rough. As a result, they're already really beat up, and enough of the bottom has scraped away that the sole started to come away from the white rubber siding. I got some superglue today and glued them back on, and started to look on the converse website to find a new pair.

Thing is: They don't sell them anymore. I should have known, because well, limited edition, but I'm not going to spend a crazy amount of money to get a new pair, but I also want these to last forever. I have already decided that I'm never going to throw them out on the basis of: Tom and Jerry (massive nostalgia factor), and they were my first pair of Converse, ever. I'm going to wear these until I can't, and then just store them away and maybe make them the first in a collection of chucks that have been loved to death. Maybe my next pair will be from the current batman series, I like the white chucks with the batman logo repeating on it and I want to try the 70s.

How do I extend the lifetime of these as long as humanly possible? Winter has pretty much just started here (Ontario, Canada), so I'm gonna put them away for the winter (I honestly prefer wearing them with shorts anyways, even though people say that high tops don't work with shorts.

Fortunately my style has always been rather on the dressy side, but I am facing a massive problem with shoes. The modern office uniform (at least here in Central Europe) of jeans + shirt allowed me to wear comfortable half-sporty stuff with no issues (think low winter sneakers with Gore-Tex and maybe some padding, or even something going in the direction of Timberland boots but less bulky). In summer that is not a problem, but in winter all of them just look sub-par with dark chinos and a blazer or similar jacket. 

I did some research on here and realise that probably people would point be to Chelsea boots or so. I'm not really sure whether they'd be universal enough for minus temperatures outside and also for the office (not to mention - I don't see a lot of them here). I'm not looking to hike directly into a boardroom, nothing so extreme, but I am very sensitive to my feet getting cold (or hot), and certainly waterproofing is an absolute must. Except some very light summer shoes I don't own any that aren't waterproof (always expecting rain). Except one pair for weddings, I also don't really have any dress shoes in the classic sense (most are to be uncomfortable and impractical).

There are some 'winter business' shoes in stores here. They look... horrific. Imagine a boxy black dress shoe with oversized rubber soles and thick padding. Yes, they would probably do the trick, but they also look like something a caricature college professor from the movies would wear.

I'm trying to figure out what size of Axel Arigato's Clean 90 would fit me better.

A famous pair of shoes that fit me perfectly are the Vans Old School, with them I use a EU 44.5.

Now Axel Arigato does not sell half sizes so I son't know if I should buy EU 44 or EU 45.

Another problem is that their conversion from EU number to US number is different:

* [Axel Arigato Size Chart](https://axelarigato.com/eur/size-guide-men/)
* [Vans Size Chart](https://www.vans.co.uk/help/size-charts.html)

&amp;#x200B;

|Brand|EU number|US number|Cm|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vans|44|10.5|28.5|
|Vans|44.5|11|29|
|Vans|45|11.5|29.5|
|Axel Arigato|44|10|28.5|
|Axel Arigato|45|11|29.2|

By the table 45 appears to be better but I have a feeling that it would be too big since I don't own any pair of shoes in EU 45 but I have to say that Vans' EU 44 is bit small and it has the same conversion to cm of Axel Arigato.

I also know that size charts are almost useless so I'd like to know by a owner of Axel Arigato if those shoes fit large or small.

If you own a pair of Axel Arigato shoes do you suggest me to size down to 44 or up do 45? Thanks in advance!",Size up or down Axel Arigato Clean 90?

I have tried out a few brands of peacoats recently but none of them have worked for me. I tried the J. Crew dock peacoat but the sleeves were too short in the medium and I was swimming in the large. I tried the Uniqlo x J.W. Anderson peacoat but it did not feel like it was quality or keep me warm with layers in 30 degree weather but the medium fit well. I tried the Red Fleece peacoat but the lack of lining was weird although the fit on the medium was still spot-on. I am hoping that you all will have some recommendations because I must have now spent over 20 hours looking for a peacoat that would work and have yet to find one.

What I am looking for:

Budget is about 250ish

Navy

Around 80% wool at least

6 buttons, preferably plain with no anchors(the dock peacoat with the extra row of buttons felt and looked weird on me)

Ability to return because I am 6'3 with a large shoulder to waist drop so finding clothes that fit well can be a challenge

It seems like a lot of brands that would potentially work like Sterlingwear, Fidelity, and Banana Republic have either stopped selling to civilians or have decided to sell different types this year. I have checked out brands like Community Clothes and Asket but the shipping and difficulty with returns has scared me off a bit. Right now the next one I might try is the Barbour Westilby which I could get for a price in my budget but I do not love the branding or the lower wool content but I would appreciate any insight people have.

425,malefashionadvice,"Having a hard time figuring out the right community to post this in and first time posting here as I seem to run into this issue every year around this time. I'm an early 40's guy with cerebral palsy which causes severe overpronation when I walk. Normally in the dry months, I wear mostly Brooks, Asics, or Saucony running shoes designed for overpronators and stability. Most of these shoes don't offer much in the way of waterproofing or even resistance being they are mostly mesh.

Again the last few days I've been on the hunt for a more weather resistant shoe for the winter. I've worn Merrells and Keens sometimes in the past but usually when you start getting into the waterproof stuff, its all pretty much boots at that point with Vibram soles that are slick on streets and sidewalks. I recently found a few Salomon shoe models that are waterproof but they look to be on the narrow side and I think the soles will be slick.

Can anyone help? I'd be wearing these mostly for casual office and occasionally dog walking.",Waterproof or resistant shoe for overpronator

This one is not too tight and seems that shoulders are okay (plenty of room) but the waist doesn't look too tailored. but the topcoat on the model also seems a little baggy around the waist - maybe it's the way it's designed? I have no idea how topcoats should fit when wearing it casually so I'd appreciate some advice.

I sized down on this one, and it looks closer to the waist/body although shoulders were noticeably tighter. Is this too tight for a topcoat?

&amp;#x200B;

I think Suitsupply's topcoat also looks good and tailored ([https://us.suitsupply.com/en\_US/coats/camel-overcoat/J455I.html?cgid=Coats](https://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/coats/camel-overcoat/J455I.html?cgid=Coats)), but I don't know if the price tag is worth it ($799 -&gt; $850 with tax and stuff) for the quality.

I usuallly just wear some basketball shorts and a t-shirt but lately I've been wanting something that feels a lot nicer to sleep in. I do have pajama pants but I actually don't like them as much because I live in an area where it's tropical so it is hot and humid all the time and at night I  use a fan instead of an AC so it can get hot sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally for a shirt I'd love something that functions like a robe but is much thinner and breathable. I know this might sound weird but I really hate putting on and taking off t shirts. For pants I'd love shorts or something even longer that is also light and breathable as well.
