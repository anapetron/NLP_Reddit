Currently luxury brands outsource their established beauty companies (YSL to L‚ÄôOr√©al, Gucci just relaunched their own lipstick line in 2019 with their name license to Coty) Herm√®s intends to have their products developed in-house and manufactured by third-party suppliers in France and Italy.

This comes after [recent news](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-bites/hermes-to-launch-skincare-cosmetics) of them planning to launch skincare and cosmetics ranges in 2020.

90,femalefashionadvice,"This post might be TMI for some but I just have to share and celebrate my realization. Lots of underwear is uncomfortable for me. So many pairs have required a lot of constant adjustment, made me feel itchy and created an odor by the end of the day. I kind of just thought, hey that's show biz, women's underwear is just inherently uncomfortable. 



Only when I put on a newly purchased pair of Aerie cotton boybriefs did I realize that was not the case. It was like getting a gentle genital hug. I realized that the issue with most of the other pairs I had ever owned was that they didn't support and contain my labia. I had somehow literally  never thought of considering my labia in underwear selection. 



After wearing my new favorite Aerie pair and comparing them to the other pairs I had in rotation, I was able to figure out exactly the qualities I need to avoid:


1. A seam down the middle. The centered seam means that the most pressure is on the center of the crotch, which is the area that needs to breathe the most. I need the tightest part of the underwear to be the leg openings, so it's like my labia are in a cozy hammock instead of being cleaved down the middle. 


2. Wide enough crotch fabric: don't give me any of this 1 or 2 inch wide bullshit. Maybe that works for some people, but for me there will be skin spillage and it won't be comfy. 


3. Good butt coverage. The alternatives are just not worth the wedgies imo. 


4. Cotton. I have heard many times from various sources that cotton underwear is best for vaginal health, but I never took the advice to heart. 



I think this all comes down to some cultural programming in my adolescence that underwear cuteness/sexiness is most important, and an aversion to anything that could be considered ""granny panties"". But I've slowly been getting rid of all the underwear that don't make me feel comfortable and supported, and it feels liberating.

I decided I will improve my style game and dress more fun, more youthful-but-still-adult, more feminine, more sexy.

At the moment, not many people in my circles are particularly stylish so I haven't been inspired lately &amp; I feel like my mind has become a bit rusty. 

I want to get creative and have many outfits for various moods and occasions, and tbh probably overdress a bit sometimes lol.

194,femalefashionadvice,"Not entirely sure if this topic is right for this subreddit, but oh well, I thought it would be really interesting!

So, what I'm asking is simple: does your sexual orientation or gender identity affect your way of dressing, and if so, how?

Personally, this is something I've been struggling with for a long time. Obviously, I've always been queer, but it's something I've had to come to terms with for a very long time. As for clarity, I'm talking about both meanings of ""queer"" in this case. :)

As for gender, I've strangely enough always struggled wearing clothes that are deemed traditionally male. I'm born female and while this is something I do not exactly feel comfortable with, wearing pants and such totally seemed to reinforce the feeling that I was dressing like the gender I felt like I really was... and that that was somehow wrong. And so, as someone who dressed like a total tomboy up until the age of 20, I then made the switch to only start wearing very traditionally feminine outfits to feel like I maybe was not really THAT queer. Turns out, I really do love my dresses, but after several years I realised that being confined to one such box made me incredibly uncomfortable. So now, at 24, I guess I'm getting ready to be whoever I want to be?

I get that cable knit sweaters, plaid shirts and jeans are very much worn by both sexes, but I guess in my case it's more about the feeling they give me. :) Some days I just want to cry wearing something feminine because it just triggers the dysphoria again, other times I just don't give a shit and then I love twirling around in a dress!

As for sexuality... I'm bi and I always have been, but apparently I looked really ""straight"" in the outfits I used to wear over the last couple of years, even if these were pretty alternative / goth-y dresses. It's starting to make me feel a little uncomfortable, especially since I've liked so many girls and none have been remotely interested in me (whereas guys do seem to like me and I don't like them nearly as much). So I've started wearing these tiny rainbow bracelets, often just underneath my sleeves, maybe just to remind myself that it's all fine. I'm even considering finally getting my ears pierced, some normal earrings at first and maybe the actual helix piercings I've wanted wanted a couple of months later (!) and I've bought myself these to finally convince myself! Terrified of needles, haha. They're chakra earrings, but eh.

If anything, clothes are mainly just super fun for me nowadays! I own a big closet that pretty much contains all colours of the rainbow to fit my mood, and it's been a great journey trying to figure out what I actually like now that I've been attempting to overcome my hang-ups. For me, clothes usually aren't really tied up all that much in my identity, and that's the perfect moment to pull out all the lilas and the greens and the baby blues... but on the other hand, sometimes they are, and that's fine to!

So, enough of my rambling! What about you? Tell me your stories, I'm very interested to hear about them!

EDIT: I just wanted to say one more thing... I've been called names a lot because of how masculine and uncomfortable I felt wearing anything but dresses and skirts, and I guess you now know why. It's very much not you, it's me, and that statement has never been about anyone but myself. &lt;3","FFA'ers on the LGBT spectrum, how does your sexual orientation or gender identity affect your way of dressing?"

If you would like to suggest changes to the schedule, you can discuss that there too. *Please do not PM me directly with suggestions.* I get approximately one billion PMs from modqueue stuff, so even if I see your message, the best way to ensure I can actually find it again is to comment in the discussion threads.
* **Do I have to do both themes?** You can do either theme or both themes!
* **Can I submit more than one outfit for a theme?** Yes! If you really dig a theme or just want to share different iterations of an outfit, feel free to share all your photos.
* **Does it have to be something I wore that day?** Not at all! If you have an outfit photo handy from the last couple of weeks that is relevant, you're welcome to post it. But add a note if it isn't recent.
* **Will themes ever repeat?** If you are keen on repeating a theme please suggest that in the Tuesday announcement/discussion thread. If a lot of people also want to try a theme again I'm down to repeat some.

They were so cute but we were pretty poor and I knew better than to ask.  My mom had to make a trip up to New York to see a family member and she brought home two bomber hats one for me and one for my sister.  I was SO excited and absolutely loved mine.

251,femalefashionadvice,"Hi all! I'm hoping to learn from you today as I've been rather rudely told to do my research about these Burberry coats by an individual on eBay. 

So I've been eyeing the Burberry Shearling Trench coats online, and gave found that the Toddingwall and the Tolladine to be ones that I really like. Personally I find these two versions to be relatively similar, the biggest difference is that the Toddingwall appears to have a slimmer, closer to a classic trench cut, while the Tolladine has a more A-line look when compared to the Toddingwall. Is this correct?

But the other question I have is, does anyone actually know how the design details differ by the year for these two coats? The eBay user got rather offended that I had made the mistake of comparing a sold 2015 version with her 2017/2018 version when I enquired about her listed cost. 

So.... Is there some Burberry coat experts out there who is willing to educate me please? I am actually quite interested to learn what the differences are between the two versions as well as how they differ by the year. Plus are there any versions I should also look out for?

I'd like to get better at using my existing clothing in new ways, and at adding new items that actually give me new and more exciting options in combination with the rest of my wardrobe. I've seen a lot about creating cohesive capsules (and as someone who enjoys one-bag travel, I'm all about that sometimes), but this is less about cohesion and more about seeing what I have and what I want to add that can expand my options: What additional looks can I create with these pieces? What do I want to buy that can do even more?

I'm sure I'm not alone here in liking Alyssa Beltempo's videos, because even though my style isn't quite like hers, I get ideas from her about how to layer and combine my own clothes in ways I haven't considered before--shapes that are versatile, silhouettes that mix well, elements that can take an outfit in more casual or more dressy directions.

I have very slim hips as in *extremely* slim hips. 33 inch I think? The number is a bit bigger because of my butt increasing it slightly. I have what you would call a slim waist (25.5), however, definitely doesn't look slim with such small hips! And to top it off, I am quite flat-chested (not as in, I have a b-cup i'm so flat-chested tee hee). 5'2. No, I'm not still growing or anything.

I've always loved the casual tuck style; however, I just can't pull it off, having no curves like this! If my hips were wider I could definitely, however, it just makes me look too straight. I've tried high-waisted jeans, and thin belts.   
This post is my last-ditch effort at trying to see if there's any way I can make it work. Any trick I haven't tried, or is it just something I can't do due to my body type? If so, it sucks because it's so trendy lately, and not only that, I personally really like the style :(

332,femalefashionadvice,"Hello!

Recently I‚Äôve been updating my pinterest board like crazy, going all over the internet to really flesh out my sense of style, and now that I‚Äôve moved on to actually buying clothes, I‚Äôve completely lost all motivation.

For reference, I‚Äôm usually a M or L top, 12-16 pant, with a 38‚Äù waist and about a 40‚Äù hip and bust. I‚Äôve never really had issues finding SOME clothes that fit me in non-plus sizes at major retailers (though sometimes they don‚Äôt fit my proportions well), but recently it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs nothing for me.

Every online thrift store caps out at a 32-34‚Äù waist, and even one of the physical thrift stores I went to capped out at 33‚Äù before you were directed to the pathetically small plus size section. I could go back to major retailers, but I thought I‚Äôd start with thrift stores because I didn‚Äôt want to drop $$$ on a piece that I don‚Äôt like wearing as much as I like looking at it.

I kind of wish I hadn‚Äôt gotten into fashion at all, because while I‚Äôve always known I‚Äôm overweight, and I have some insecurities, it never bothered me that much because I knew I ate well and got decent exercise daily (which has always been what‚Äôs most important to me). Now, though...I just feel like garbage. I haven‚Äôt felt this bad about myself since middle school.

Have any of you experienced something similar, and what did you do to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it? Is there some trick I‚Äôm unaware of, or are these stores just not meant for me?

# Themes for this week are Neons and ""Change the Peripherals""

## Neons

Have you gone all in on the neon green trend? Have a single neon item that you've been procrastinating on actually wearing? Have you been rocking neons in all shades for years? This is your time to ~~shine~~ blind us all with your highlighter toned awesomeness, whether it's with one item, head to toe, or somewhere in between.

My usual search of MFA and FFA didn't turn up any inspo or discussion on neon, so I made a quick **[inspo album](https://imgur.com/a/Dvc0HGi)**. If you prefer Pinterest, [here](https://www.pinterest.com/ter4gr4m/neon/) is the board.

## Change the Peripherals

Couldn't think of a better name (""accessories, outerwear, and shoes"" is too long, ""restyle"" is too vague...), but for this prompt, **submit 2 outfits that are the same base outfit, but with different shoes, outerwear, and/or accessories**. Restyle a look, whether you subtly swap shoes or go full style chameleon.

I am so in love with these beautiful bags for so many reasons, but mostly where the money goes. We talk a lot about fast fashion and its effects. These bags are handmade by indigenous Guatemalan women who practice this native Mayan embroidery as part of their culture. Each bag is 100% unique, handcrafted leather and they're high quality. 

The best part is that the owner (the real life actual FULL OWNER) is a Guatemalan woman. She's doing this specifically to provide income to the women of her country so they can provide for their families and their children can get an education, and keep the indigenous art alive. I mean. If there was ever a thing I could get behind, it's this.

Well, I wear jeans to work literally every day and it's the cheap kind. I paid ‚Ç¨30 for the skinny jeans I'm wearing now and they're rubbish. I've also got some mom jeans from Zara that are a similar price but I'm pretty pleased with those. I'd mistakenly thought, ""Well I wear jeans every day so I may as well just buy cheap ones"" rather than what everyone else suggested which was: ""You get so much wear out of jeans, so invest in some good ones!""

I'm in a job now where I can afford to invest in some decent jeans that will last more than a year and that I feel great in.

So my questions to you are:

1. Where do you buy your good denim? What brands should I be looking at? (I'm based in the Netherlands, so European/worldwide suggestions would be great!!)

I'm trying to decide between two different $120 pairs at Nordstrom but I'm not familiar with either of the brands quality. I have a larger head (O/S hats tend to be too small) and chin length very geometric/vidall sassoon inspired bob with straight across bangs that border on baby bangs, if that helps anyone give me advice.

468,femalefashionadvice,"Hi!

I love this community and I wanted to touch base with you about whether I should be confused at the way Millennial-friendly brands address their customers. Places like CATBIRD, Reformation, Drunk Elephant (beauty, I know) and Realisation Par talk to their customers--who are supposed to have some affluence due to their price tags by totally infantilizing them

Why is Realisation Par just talking about dreamgirls who can get away with accidentally bruising their dad's cars?

Why is Catbird calling someone who can spend $400 on a SINGLE earring KITTEN?

Why does Reformation love referencing high-school dynamics? 

Why would I spend $80 for a product called BABYFACIAL?

What are your thoughts on this, and on ig-brands's obsession with youth? do you have other glaring examples of this that can make my blood boil?

WAYWT (""What are you wearing today""), but with themes! It's co-ed and hosted by FFA. Share some inspiration photos, float your outfit ideas, and discuss this week's themes here! The goal is to have some fun creating outfits in a slightly more focused way, not to win a contest on Who Can Be The Most Theme.

# Themes for this week are Neons and ""Change the Peripherals""

## Neons

Have you gone all in on the neon green trend? Have a single neon item that you've been procrastinating on actually wearing? Have you been rocking neons in all shades for years? This is your time to ~~shine~~ blind us all with your highlighter toned awesomeness, whether it's with one item, head to toe, or somewhere in between.

My usual search of MFA and FFA didn't turn up any inspo or discussion on neon, so I made a quick **[inspo album](https://imgur.com/a/Dvc0HGi)**. If you prefer Pinterest, [here](https://www.pinterest.com/ter4gr4m/neon/) is the board.

## Change the Peripherals

Couldn't think of a better name (""accessories, outerwear, and shoes"" is too long, ""restyle"" is too vague...), but for this prompt, **submit 2 outfits that are the same base outfit, but with different shoes, outerwear, and/or accessories**. Restyle a look, whether you subtly swap shoes or go full style chameleon.

# FAQ

* **Can I suggest a theme or changes to the schedule?** Of course! Please suggest themes in the theme WAYWT discussion threads and include the full description that will be posted for it. It's great to include some examples, links to inspiration, and things to consider. If you would like to suggest changes to the schedule, you can discuss that there too. *Please do not PM me directly with suggestions.* I get approximately one billion PMs from modqueue stuff, so even if I see your message, the best way to ensure I can actually find it again is to comment in the discussion threads.
* **Do I have to do both themes?** You can do either theme or both themes!
* **Can I submit more than one outfit for a theme?** Yes! If you really dig a theme or just want to share different iterations of an outfit, feel free to share all your photos.
* **Does it have to be something I wore that day?** Not at all! If you have an outfit photo handy from the last couple of weeks that is relevant, you're welcome to post it. But add a note if it isn't recent.
* **Will themes ever repeat?** If you are keen on repeating a theme please suggest that in the Tuesday announcement/discussion thread. If a lot of people also want to try a theme again I'm down to repeat some.
* **Can I use the same outfit in Theme WAYWT and in the regular WAYWT?** Yep!
* **What is ""CCW""?** It means ""Constructive Criticism Welcome"". If you would like to receive CC on your post, you can increase the chances of getting replies by asking for feedback on a specific aspect of your outfit, e.g. ""I'm interested in suggestions for elevating this outfit without the use of jewelry"" or ""I'd like to know if these pants hit at a good spot for this outfit"".",Theme WAYWT Discussion Thread: Neons // Change the Peripherals

18,femalefashionadvice,"Weird question, I know. Since I was a kid I always just kind of hated most clothing. There were a few outliers that I tolerated. But none of them really resonated with my personality. I'm a guy btw, but I hate male clothing almost universally. So I sort of found a home with female clothing. There was still something missing though.

I don't like the modern aesthetic of clothing. They are far too homogeneous and uniform looking. Untouched by the elements, lacking in personality. I have always found more rugged, tattered, almost nomadic clothing fascinating. Tribal clothing too. Significantly longer in length and typically oversized. Often found in medieval illustrations and post-apocalyptic video games. Yet no one sells this kind of clothing. People assimilate into a very narrow selection of options. Which is awfully convenient for companies trying to maintain efficiency. Also, it is further constraining to understand that many of the apparel options that I actually love, like dresses and skirts, aren't made for men either. If there's a single culture that vaguely conveys what I want to wear it's probably Arabian ones. Where more ""archaic"" clothing is considered more traditional. And men are permitted to wear longer clothing like robes. They still lack the sense of ware and complexity that I love. But they are a fine example.

Regardless, none of this exists in the United States. You can actually search endlessly, they don't exist. There is literally no supply. Since I was little I've sort of conformed and [worn](https://i.imgur.com/9M4FGQB.jpg) predominately oversized sweat pants and shirts. They still don't feel like ""me"". I am still not able to wear the clothing I want to wear. And it's kind of frustrating. Constantly going to clothing stores, expecting to find nothing you actively want, and inevitably compromising on something your familiar with.

I'd like to buy a skirt. To just see how I feel about them. But then I'm gay and confused about my gender. Which happens to be true. But I'm not looking for any attention. Nor do I want to lend credence to that stereotype. No, I don't want a fucking kilt. This [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/edjcc7/meme_ahem/) was particularly inspiring to me. It made me realize how incongruent I feel with traditional clothing options and expectations in the western hemisphere. 

This is part of the reason that I love video games like Dark Souls so much. Because I can actually present how I want to irl. Here I am romanticizing how I wish I could dress

So ya.... I think a large part of my frustration is admittedly gender dysphoria. I realized that as I finished writing this. But I think another large portion is the fact that the clothing I love is genuinely not manufactured/acceptable/available anymore. If no one reads this, whatever. I had to write my thoughts down somewhere.",I feel like clothing simply doesn't exist to suit my style. Anyone else?

22,femalefashionadvice,"Bettie page has been a source of fashion inspiration for a few years now. In those years i‚Äôve learnt a lot about vintage, pin up and provocative fashion and both the controversy and the praise that follows it. It‚Äôs ironic that there‚Äôs something so fresh about the fashion of the 50‚Äôs as compared to the repetitive-ness of mainstream fashion today. Boundries were constantly being broken. Bigger figures were celebrated,  and whilst admittedly women didn‚Äôt have as much freedom in the household, in the media, anything went.

38,femalefashionadvice,"Hi all-

I‚Äôm starting a new job in a couple days and after months of unemployment feel totally unprepared to dress for the office. I‚Äôve steadily gained weight over the last few years so this is also combined with not really knowing the best way to dress my body in general.

I want to hide my tummy as much as possible and also be conscious of not showing off boobs &amp; butt too much (this is my biggest issue with dressing more professionally- a lot of the inspiration I find is stuff that would look ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù on me because of my bust size) I‚Äôm also quite short so I find I get a little messed up on proportions (like I feel like I should always tuck my shirt in to not make my legs look even shorter but then it often makes my belly more pronounced??)

I‚Äôm not totally sure about the dress code in my new job but based on my interview I think it‚Äôs Casual with a lot of people choosing to dress a little nicer. I‚Äôm a designer so I definitely feel like I can have some fun with my outfits and don‚Äôt need to go for a fully professional look. The designer ‚Äúuniform‚Äù is basically T-shirt, nice jeans, blazer but I‚Äôve never felt comfortable in blazers.

I‚Äôm having a really hard time finding both inspiration and the clothes themselves. So, I come to you for help finding the following!

1. Outfit inspiration - things you‚Äôve worn, people you follow, random outfits you‚Äôve found etc. just really need to see them on a curvier body type.

2. Recommendations for stores to check out or HG wardrobe pieces that would be worth putting into my regular work rotation

I'm not sure whether it's my personality or upbringing or is it a result of being bullied and thinking ""I'm fat and ugly so why even bother""...

## Button Down/Up shirts

Wear one in your outfit. Pretty much it. Bonus points if you get a little more creative with it. I think most people are aware of the basic bastard and bizcaz sorts of looks so I tried to include some *slightly* more offbeat MFA albums instead of just r/navyblazer shirt styling. And just to clarify up front for the pedants out there, for the purposes of theme WAYWT *either* button up or button down shirts are acceptable.

# FAQ

* **Can I suggest a theme or changes to the schedule?** Of course! Please suggest themes in the theme WAYWT discussion threads and include the full description that will be posted for it. It's great to include some examples, links to inspiration, and things to consider. If you would like to suggest changes to the schedule, you can discuss that there too. *Please do not PM me directly with suggestions.* I get approximately one billion PMs from modqueue stuff, so even if I see your message, the best way to ensure I can actually find it again is to comment in the discussion threads.
* **Do I have to do both themes?** You can do either theme or both themes!
* **Can I submit more than one outfit for a theme?** Yes! If you really dig a theme or just want to share different iterations of an outfit, feel free to share all your photos.
* **Does it have to be something I wore that day?** Not at all! If you have an outfit photo handy from the last couple of weeks that is relevant, you're welcome to post it. But add a note if it isn't recent.
* **Will themes ever repeat?** If you are keen on repeating a theme please suggest that in the Tuesday announcement/discussion thread. If a lot of people also want to try a theme again I'm down to repeat some.
* **Can I use the same outfit in Theme WAYWT and in the regular WAYWT?** Yep!
* **What is ""CCW""?** It means ""Constructive Criticism Welcome"". If you would like to receive CC on your post, you can increase the chances of getting replies by asking for feedback on a specific aspect of your outfit, e.g. ""I'm interested in suggestions for elevating this outfit without the use of jewelry"" or ""I'd like to know if these pants hit at a good spot for this outfit"".","Theme WAYWT January 11, 2020: Outdoorsy // Button Down Shirts"

116,femalefashionadvice,"Hello, I think a thread about bags would be pretty interesting... here are my questions:

1. I don't know how i should carry/hold my handbag. In my hand, it looks a bit weird and not so classy. Inside the shoulder, i feel it's too show off and don't know what to make with my hand if that makes sense. 

2. What bag do you wear for college ? I like to wear bags (either big  enough to carry my notebook, since i dont need any book or laptop, or small and i carry my notebook  ( between 1 and 3) with my hands). Perhaps you could show us the model on imgur (would be better if you are wearing it with an outfit !)

3. I saw a girl having a backpack and a smaller bag/kinda classier purse that she cans wears like a bandouillere (not sure of the translation in english). I quite like the idea since i can leave the backpack in class and then on breaks or when walking outside the class (i have the same classeroom for the whole day.. usually)i can take the small purse. Not sure if its stylish though, i'd  like to stay fashionable,put together and classy. I live close to university, well quite close, and my schedule is for less than 8 hours per day so I don't need to dress down or wear lounge wear etc. 

4. Do you recommend a quick easy lock for backpacks ?",Let's talk about bags

While I have no doubt that the good brands are good, they come in widely varying price points.

It's not been a huge issue in the past (outside wrecked self-esteem, phew) since I was a tee'n'jeans type of nerd who always avoided formal gatherings and weddings but due to my job I recently started experimenting with more formal looks and it's... problematic. 

At 175cm tall (5,7 feet?), thin figure and barely any boobage I look like an ironing board in any top that's not a basic t-shirt. Cardigans and concealing outerwear help a tiny bit but not a lot.

Back in high school I tried various push-ups but the padding was always super obvious even with a child's size bra so that doesn't seem to be an option.

The goal is to have some fun creating outfits in a slightly more focused way, not to win a contest on Who Can Be The Most Theme.


# Themes for this week are Outdoorsy and Button Down Shirts

## Outdoorsy

Express your outdoorsy side (or what its condensed aesthetic would be if you had one) whether you're inspired by current day [gorpcore](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/6dfhxb/first_came_normcore_now_get_ready_for_gorpcore/), vintage park ranger uniforms, throwback lumberjack looks from ye olde 2013, or hell, just actually incorporate your gear into some casual outfits.

## Button Down/Up shirts

Wear one in your outfit. Pretty much it. Bonus points if you get a little more creative with it. I think most people are aware of the basic bastard and bizcaz sorts of looks so I tried to include some *slightly* more offbeat MFA albums instead of just r/navyblazer shirt styling. And just to clarify up front for the pedants out there, for the purposes of theme WAYWT *either* button up or button down shirts are acceptable.

* FFA inspo [everyday androgyny](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/ax2u65/basic_everyday_androgyny_inspo/) not exclusively button down shirts, but there are a lot of them

# FAQ

* **Can I suggest a theme or changes to the schedule?** Of course! Please suggest themes in the theme WAYWT discussion threads and include the full description that will be posted for it. It's great to include some examples, links to inspiration, and things to consider. If you would like to suggest changes to the schedule, you can discuss that there too. *Please do not PM me directly with suggestions.* I get approximately one billion PMs from modqueue stuff, so even if I see your message, the best way to ensure I can actually find it again is to comment in the discussion threads.
* **Do I have to do both themes?** You can do either theme or both themes!
* **Can I submit more than one outfit for a theme?** Yes! If you really dig a theme or just want to share different iterations of an outfit, feel free to share all your photos.
* **Does it have to be something I wore that day?** Not at all! If you have an outfit photo handy from the last couple of weeks that is relevant, you're welcome to post it. But add a note if it isn't recent.
* **Will themes ever repeat?** If you are keen on repeating a theme please suggest that in the Tuesday announcement/discussion thread. If a lot of people also want to try a theme again I'm down to repeat some.
* **Can I use the same outfit in Theme WAYWT and in the regular WAYWT?** Yep!
* **What is ""CCW""?** It means ""Constructive Criticism Welcome"". If you would like to receive CC on your post, you can increase the chances of getting replies by asking for feedback on a specific aspect of your outfit, e.g. ""I'm interested in suggestions for elevating this outfit without the use of jewelry"" or ""I'd like to know if these pants hit at a good spot for this outfit"".",Theme WAYWT Discussion Thread: Outdoorsy // Button Down Shirts

285,femalefashionadvice,"I am a dog trainer and work at a dog daycare. While my daycare job has a uniform, when I'm a dog trainer, I can dress however I want. But I'm struggling a bit in how to make my wardrobe seem professional while being casual enough that someone isn't mortified if their dog jumps up on me and practical enough that when that dog does jump on me, it's not a huge issue! And practical enough that I can launder everything... Dogs are dirty, yo! 

Honestly, I just look young (I'm 30, but most assume I'm in my early 20s, particularly as I live in a college town) and want to look older and competent.

I know this has to be something others are struggling with as well, given that dress codes are becoming more and more casual, even if you don't have the added difficulty of dealing with dogs! 

Right now I generally wear black skinny jeans, black tennis shoes or hiking boots depending on the weather and either a plain v-neck tee or a plaid flannel (usually it's a darker plaid - green and black, dark green, purple, navy, maroon). If it's cold, I usually throw on a fleece zip up. I do also often wear a [vest](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41fF4w%2BBo4L._AC_SY400_ML3_.jpg) or essentially a fanny pack for treats.

When I worked an office job, I could easily use clothing to make myself seem more... together, but now I'm just not quite sure! Honestly, I'm a bit worried it's all in the hair and makeup because those are two areas I'm trash in...

I have been invited to a May wedding (UK) Church then reception venue. Invite says dress code is cocktail.

Are cocktail dresses even the same as that anymore? The bride is quite posh and lived in London so her friends are likely to be trendier than us country bumpkins. I would normally wear a smart floral dress to a wedding, but that doesn‚Äôt fit with my idea of what a cocktail dress is.

# FAQ

* **Can I suggest a theme or changes to the schedule?** Of course! Please suggest themes in the theme WAYWT discussion threads and include the full description that will be posted for it. It's great to include some examples, links to inspiration, and things to consider. If you would like to suggest changes to the schedule, you can discuss that there too. *Please do not PM me directly with suggestions.* I get approximately one billion PMs from modqueue stuff, so even if I see your message, the best way to ensure I can actually find it again is to comment in the discussion threads.
* **Do I have to do both themes?** You can do either theme or both themes!
* **Can I submit more than one outfit for a theme?** Yes! If you really dig a theme or just want to share different iterations of an outfit, feel free to share all your photos.
* **Does it have to be something I wore that day?** Not at all! If you have an outfit photo handy from the last couple of weeks that is relevant, you're welcome to post it. But add a note if it isn't recent.
* **Will themes ever repeat?** If you are keen on repeating a theme please suggest that in the Tuesday announcement/discussion thread. If a lot of people also want to try a theme again I'm down to repeat some.
* **Can I use the same outfit in Theme WAYWT and in the regular WAYWT?** Yep!
* **What is ""CCW""?** It means ""Constructive Criticism Welcome"". If you would like to receive CC on your post, you can increase the chances of getting replies by asking for feedback on a specific aspect of your outfit, e.g. ""I'm interested in suggestions for elevating this outfit without the use of jewelry"" or ""I'd like to know if these pants are cuffed at a good length for this outfit"".","Theme WAYWT January 04, 2020: Break a Fashion ""Rule"" // Scarves"

366,femalefashionadvice,"Ever think, ""This post ought to be highlighted in the FFA sidebar/wiki!"" or

""I would like to write or create something but I don't know if it's what FFA wants?""

Maybe you would like to see a guide or crowdsourcing thread from a few years ago updated. Maybe you are interested in discussing concepts behind how to style a particular item. Well now is your opportunity!

The aim is to make a list of content that FFA would like to see in the hopes we can, in some way, try to match up users' desired content with what is being produced. We're also planning to continue improving the wiki, so content which can be slotted into the collection of advice there (as it is, after all, r/femalefashionadvice) is particularly great. This type of thread [seems to be somewhat productive on MFA](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/d86p3p/crowdsourcing_the_mfa_list_of_content_you_would/), where we have stolen this idea and intro text from, and figured it was worth a try here.

**What this thread is**

A place to suggest specific content that you would like to see created or added to the wiki, or get some direction/feedback/gauge interest in content that you're interested in creating.

**What this thread is not**

A place to post the actual new content in response to suggestions (create a top level post!), though if you know of an existing post relevant to a request feel free to share.

Any sort of guarantee that suggestions will be followed up on. FFA is a forum of the entire userbase collaborating on advice and discussion, not a product. 

-----------------------

If you are thinking ""What sidebar? Reddit a list of threads?"" you are most likely using the site through a platform that uses a minimal design, such as the default mobile browser view. For general reference, there are quick links to the wiki [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/faq) and [Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/resources) pages at the top of the stickied post [Welcome to FFA! Read this before posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/bmxxwv/welcome_to_ffa_read_this_before_posting/).

-----------------------

We recognize that many of users browse reddit from platforms which do not show the sidebar or show a tab for the wiki, so if it looks like new content does actually spring up from this post, we're hoping to periodically (but not on any exact schedule, though probably something like every other month) post digests of previous suggestions and promote resources for new subscribers, solicit more suggestions, and plug things that have been created since the last one.

To make this as actionable as possible, be specific in your suggestions, but not so specific as to be personalized so it's likely only relevant to yourself. Some examples of **less helpful** suggestions:

* ""inspo albums""
* ""advice on how to dress better""
* ""guide on how to dress edgy prep in a casual office with a preference for sustainable brands available in Canada""

Anyway, for some ideas for discussion:

# Existing content which you think is generally useful enough it should be cataloged in the Resources page of the wiki

If possible, link directly to the thread.

# Types of inspo albums you'd like to see

We do have the recurring Share &amp; Request Inspo threads for more personalized content or small Pinterest boards/albums that are not meaty enough to be a top level post, so this would be for full blown inspo albums.

While there are definitely recurring flavors of inspo posts (i.e. ones based on particular aesthetics/styles), that doesn't mean those are the only types of inspo styles that are allowed! Let everyone know if you're interested in seeing things like

* ""inspiration albums on current microtrends, like _____""
* ""inspiration albums with strict bizcaz friendly outfits""
* ""inspiration albums discussing concepts for styling specific types of items like [visible socks](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3nl425/visible_sock_album_winter/) or [particular color combinations](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/dvbx4i/green_x_red_a_color_combo_inspo_album/)""
* ""inspiration albums that feature things from recent runway shows""

The subreddit guidelines for inspo albums can be found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/inspohelp)

# Review/recommendation threads you'd like to see

This type of post is more common in MFA, but they have been a thing here sporadically, like [Thrift Store Map of the World](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/cf7wwh/thrift_store_map_of_the_world/) and the [Crowdsourced Denim Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/7ucy9n/crowdsourced_denim_recommendations/). If there's interest, we can start these up again and can use suggestions on which specific ones would be of most interest.

Example suggestions:

* ""crowdsourced 'favorite &lt;item type&gt; for $__' threads, I'm particularly interested in casual outerwear and chelsea boots""
* ""crowdsourced recommendation threads based on measurements, I'm particularly interested in cropped pants and midi skirts""

# Guides or albums you've been thinking of creating, but would like some feedback/direction on before committing

We recognize that it is a lot of work to create a post! Want some feedback on perhaps which nuances would be more interesting for people? Want to sanity check whether an idea is too general or specific? Everyone is always welcome to ask for this sort of feedback in General Discussion and Random Fashion thoughts, but this is appropriate for this thread as well.


**This is not an all inclusive list of the types of content that could be suggested/created. Again, being specific helps give other users direction, and makes it more likely someone will be inspired to create something from the prompt.** And of course aside from these heavier types of content, remember that anyone can always start a standalone fashion discussion, or link to an interesting article and include a point or two for discussion. Let's be the subreddit we want to see!

--------------------

Edit: To be clear on the expected timeline and outcomes of this thread ‚Äì the mod team will be reading and discussing all the suggestions and will post a follow up thread announcing any changes we will be making after the survey is also closed and analyzed, which is probably going to be 3 weeks out minimum from today since we're keeping the survey up for 2 weeks.",Crowdsourcing FFA Content + Wiki Updates: What do you want to see and create?

404,femalefashionadvice,"Hello, FFA! Long time lurker, first time poster. 

This year, I am committing to truly clearing out my wardrobe and keeping only the things I 1) will wear and 2) want to wear. 

I have too much stuff. My closet (and my dresser, and the piles of stuff that inevitably end up on the floor) overwhelm me. I do regularly purge things that I no longer like, no longer fit me, etc. 


My struggle is this: there are many items I have that I GENUINELY like. I‚Äôm an avid thrifter and deal finder. I don‚Äôt have a single ‚Äústyle‚Äù or ‚Äúaesthetic.‚Äù There are so many things that I‚Äôm drawn to, and even if they rarely are things that I actually wear, I struggle giving them up because I really LIKE them. 

And, really, although I often dumb down what I wear to the most basic things (leggings and a crew neck sweatshirt, etc), I don‚Äôt want that to be the foundation of my style. So giving away things that I really like (but rarely wear) feels like I‚Äôm giving up on myself and the person I aspire to be. 

And, how do you balance the things that are rarely worn because of what they are? I have a bunch of ugly Christmas sweaters that are really only worn for about three weeks out of the year, but I am a teacher and I love those three weeks of the kids getting a kick out of the sweaters. But there‚Äôs a LOT of them and they take up a LOT of space without being used for 95% of the year. 

I have too much stuff. I need to purge my wardrobe. 

But how do I find the balance between keeping things that I love, (but don‚Äôt wear very often) and keeping the things that I do wear (but often settle on because it‚Äôs easy/comfy/etc?)",How to clear one‚Äôs wardrobe of ‚Äúaspirational‚Äù clothing without feeling like you‚Äôre giving up?

They lasted me two years of continuous wear and couple washes. They were designer as well so surprised they didn't last too long. It's always been hard for me to find jeans since moving to the UK. I am 5""1 and most short jeans are too long for me. I need like a 24"" length, but most short jeans are 28"" length which leaves the bottom of my pants all scrunched up instead of like how the model wears them.

I bought a replacement pair today, but it seems like I'm buying a new pair every two years or so. Is it normal for jeans to not last as long as they used to?

Any tips to make them last longer?",How often do you replace your jeans?
408,femalefashionadvice,"Edit/Update: I'm returning everything. I was already pretty convinced I'd return it all, but I figured someone may see something I was missing. None of these were anything I wouldn't buy myself (but I'd buy at Goodwill or Marshall's for a fraction of the cost). I'm really disappointed in the lack of quality and style. I thought at the very least I'd get something trendy that I wouldn't necessarily feel comfortable picking out. I wasn't expecting a bunch of lounge clothes.

&amp;#x200B;

Original Post: For the new year, I decided I'd try Stich Fix. I've heard so many controversial things about it, but I found some awesome pieces at Goodwill (including my favorite black pants) that some other Stich Fixer had donated, so I thought, hey, it's worth a shot.

The box arrived today. Ok, first impression upon opening the box: ""Wow! This is so neatly packed!""

The first paper I pulled out was the invoice - I have NEVER spent so much on clothes - the cheapest item in the box was $38!!! Definitely a turn-off, but I kept going. The note from my stylist was great - she had clearly read my profile and tried to choose pieces accordingly. Definitely sweet!

I stated in my profile that I am primarily trying Stich Fix to try out new looks and pieces that I'd never buy myself in a store.  Shared my likes as jewel tones and comfortable office casual. Not big on dresses/skirts. I also shared that I'm starting a new job in January that's remote, so I can be extra casual most of the time, but I will need pieces that are appropriate for video calls and my church job (church job requires concert black attire). In terms of size, I was very honest with what sizes I typically buy.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the clothes I got (sorry the color sucks in the pics - in real life, they're all great colors):

409,femalefashionadvice,"I know women tend to get more flak for wearing the same thing to repeated events than men do, but I am rapidly entering that point in my life when I'm being expected to attend multiple weddings per year, company galas, etc and I feel like I want something that I don't have to think about, that is simple enough to be dressed up with different accessories. So I guess my question is, if you had to pick one dress to wear to every black tie or black tie optional event for the forseeable future, what would you pick? What silhouettes do you think will stand the test of time, and what is going to look super dated in 5 years? Even if you don't think you'd personally be interested in investing in a single dress, I thought it could be fun to at least see what other people would consider neutral enough to do this with, but interesting enough not to just be boring.

&amp;nbsp;

**Background**

Industrialisation and out-sourcing to overseas industrial markets have lowered supply chain costs for fashion brands, enabling a culture that prioritises cheap, seasonal [throwaway clothing](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ijcs.12169). We‚Äôve gone from occasionally buying well-made, quality items that were made to last, to a business model with [‚Äòplanned obsolesce‚Äô](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ijcs.12159) and impulse purchases built in, at the cost of long-term sustainability.

Clothing prices have risen slower compared to other consumer goods and thanks to shorter lead times new designs can enter shops weekly, or even daily. Zara manufactures an estimated 450 million garments a year, while in 2016 the UK population binned [300‚Äô000 tonnes](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/11/uk-households-binned-300000-tonnes-of-clothing-in-2016) of clothing. (That‚Äôs the weight of about 75‚Äô000 Asian elephants).

On the whole, society encourages this behaviour. Certain parts of the media persist in calling out celebrities who make the terrible faux pas of wearing an outfit more than once, while the ‚Äúfunny‚Äù struggles of a shopaholic is a bestselling book series (an addiction that is actually a recognised psychiatric disorder called [oniomania](https://europepmc.org/article/med/20054795)).

The total footprint of clothing in use in the UK, including global and territorial emissions, was [26.2 million tonnes CO2e](https://www.wrap.org.uk/sustainable-textiles/valuing-our-clothes) in 2016. That‚Äôs roughly the emission equivalent of [5.5m cars](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator), or all the homes in Wales.

The total water footprint of clothing in active use in the UK in 2016, including the water consumed overseas to make our clothes, was [8 billion m3 of water](https://www.wrap.org.uk/sustainable-textiles/valuing-our-clothes). This is the equivalent of over [70‚Äô000](https://www.ccwater.org.uk/households/using-water-wisely/averagewateruse/) 2-person households.

Most of this water is used during the growing and production of fibres. For instance, the global average water footprint for 1 kilogram of cotton - equivalent to the weight of one man‚Äôs shirt and a pair of jeans is [10,000 - 20,000 litres](https://www.wrap.org.uk/sustainable-textiles/valuing-our-clothes).

As well as guzzling much of the available clean water (often in countries experiencing severe water stress), the textile-production industries contribute to freshwater contamination. It‚Äôs estimated that [20% of freshwater pollution](https://www.wrap.org.uk/sustainable-textiles/valuing-our-clothes) comes from textile treatment and dyeing. Waste water is usually not treated to remove pollutants being disposed in water bodies, often primary sources of drinking water for local people. The waste water contains chemicals such as formaldehyde, organochlorines, PBDEs, phthalates, and heavy metals that can cause severe health problems for both humans and wildlife.

Take denim for instance. Naturally, it is actually a shade of [grey/beige](http://summerhousetextile.com/PhotoAlbumsPro/denim/3denwhi.jpg?cache=0.33045508442643223). It has to be dyed and undergo a series of harsh treatments (such as sand-blasting or acid-wash) to get the distressed, indigo colour that‚Äôs so popular. Xintang, China is known as the [‚Äújeans capital of the world‚Äù](https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/6283-The-denim-capital-of-the-world-so-polluted-you-can-t-give-the-houses-away). In 2013 it‚Äôs thought they were producing 1 in 3 pairs of jeans sold, at great personal cost. The local river ran blue, the dust in the city was blue, and when it rained the puddles were blue. Water quality tests found high levels of lead, copper and (in one case 128 times over the recommended limit). The pH level reached as high as 11.95. Since then many of these factories have been shut down, but often that just means a relocation to another poor area.

Natural fibres are still not as bad as synthetic fibres such as nylon or polyester, which use petroleum-based raw materials, and I haven‚Äôt even gone into the impacts from process waste.

&amp;nbsp;

**Social costs**

We mustn‚Äôt forget the social cost of fast fashion either, such as the 2013 [Rana Plaza disaster](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/19/rana-plaza-bangladesh-one-year-on) in Bangladesh. An 8-story building containing mostly garment workers collapsed. Safety warnings had been issued due to visible cracks in the structure, but some clothing factories producing garments for brands such as Benetton, Monsoon, Walmart and Primark refused to allow their workers to evacuate. &gt;1000 people were killed, orphaning ~800 children. Both before and after this tragic incident there have been numerous fatal factory fires.

Walmart has still not signed the resulting [Accord on Fire and Building Safety](https://bangladeshaccord.org/) in Bangladesh

&amp;nbsp;

**My reaction to this**

A few days after Christmas I went shopping with my mum and nana. We wandered through rows of discounted clothes in Next, dodging frenzied shoppers trying to grab a bargain. Later they both discussed when they‚Äôd get new outfits for my cousin‚Äôs upcoming wedding in summer. I also got married in summer a few years ago, and they both had new outfits for that. Neither of them have reworn the dresses, despite being the same size. My mum has a walk-in closet that she literally cannot enter because it is so full of clothes. The next day my cousin complained that she‚Äôd seen a pretty dress in Monsoon for the flower girls, but it was overpriced and she didn‚Äôt want to pay ¬£48. 

I‚Äôve been making my own clothes for several years now, and it‚Äôs really opened my eyes to how shockingly low the prices are on the high street. I‚Äôve made plenty of casual dresses that required ~¬£40 of material and ~ 8 hours of work. To turn a profit, I wouldn‚Äôt want to sell them for less than ¬£120. Similar styles (though of lower quality) can probably be bought for ¬£20 in the shops. Even taking into account wholesale costs, efficiencies of scale and lower living costs in different countries, I wondered how a ¬£20 dress could possibly involve the fair treatment of factory workers and sustainable production processes. Well now I know the answer ‚Äì it can‚Äôt.

&amp;nbsp;

**Sustainable clothing**
There has been a proliferation of ‚Äòethical‚Äô clothing brands, even in the designer market. E.g. [Edun](https://edun.com/pages/mission) or [Maiyet](https://maiyet.com/), but they‚Äôre still relatively niche. Some mainstream designers, such as Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney, have always had sustainability as a core principle, but they‚Äôre certainly in the minority.

Celebrities have also been getting on board with the cause. Rosario Dawson for example, co-founded [Studio 189](https://studiooneeightynine.com/pages/about-us), a sustainable fashion brand and social enterprise based in Africa 

Pharrell Williams has been championing recycled plastic in his role as the creative director of [Bionic Yarn](https://www.bionicyarn.com/origins.html). They repurpose recovered plastic debris from the oceans. He recently teamed up G-Star Raw, to launch Raw for the Oceans, a collection of jeans made from recycled ocean plastic.

There‚Äôs a lot of research going on into the production of sustainable textiles, including yarn made from coffee beans and leather from apples. Few are ready to be scaled up to the wider market however.

It would be amiss of me to overlook the outdoor clothing brand Patagonia. They manage their infrastructure to reduce resource use and [1% of all sales](https://www.patagonia.com/environmental-grants-and-support.html) go support environmental organizations around the world. They conduct [environmental assessments](https://www.patagonia.com/reference-library.html) of materials and make the results public so other companies can benefit. 

They also own up to the fact that not all workers in factories producing Patagonia clothes do not earn a [living wage](https://www.patagonia.com/corporate-responsibility-faqs.html), but they‚Äôre actively trying to remedy that with the Fair Labor Association‚Äôs and Fair Trade USA. Incidentally, they offer more [Fair Trade](https://www.patagonia.com/fair-trade-certified.html) styles than any other apparel brand. Perhaps most interestingly, they have a scheme where you can [trade in](https://wornwear.patagonia.com/) used clothes for store credit, and they will resell them

Despite all this, ethical clothing sales account for only 0.4% of the market. In my view, there are 3 main issues:

1.	*Marketing*. ‚ÄúSustainable‚Äù clothing conjures up images of hemp and tie dye. It needs a serious rebrand. At the basic level, consumers need to want to wear the clothes. You pick up a dress because it‚Äôs pretty, not because its production used 10% less water. 

2.	*Availability*. Most people still shop on the high street, often as a leisure or social activity. Unless sustainable clothes are hanging on the rack right in front of them, the average consumer just isn‚Äôt going to make a special effort to find it.

3.	*Price*. Clothing that is made with justice, for the planet and the workers, is not going to be cheap. Our conception of appropriate clothing prices has been horrible skewed by fast fashion. We need to reevaluate what clothing is actually worth. 

This leads us into a bit of a chicken and egg situation. Mainstream brands aren‚Äôt going to invest wholesale in sustainable clothing unless consumers are willing to pay a premium for it. Consumers want to be able to browse clothes on the highstreet and they‚Äôre not going to happily fork out a lot more money for an item, unless that price becomes the new normal

Ideally, we need fashion retailors in a range of price brackets, from Monsoon to Primark, to commit as an industry to sustainability. (Commit with actions, not words). When every single t-shirt on the high street is made with organic cotton, then consumer preferences become immaterial. Until then however, consumers need to demonstrate a willingness to pay for sustainability.

Designers need to invest in sustainable production processes. They must choose organic options for natural fibres, recycled options for synthetics, or new eco-textiles such as lyocell, which has a closed-loop production system. Consumers need to vote with their wallet and actually buy them!

&amp;nbsp;

**What we can do**

* As the saying goes, reduce reuse recycle. Consider participating in challenges like [Buy Nothing New Month](https://buynothingnew.com.au/). Do you really need a new outfit for that party? Why not try restyling a dress you already have? Or can you participate in a clothing swap with friends, or shop from thrift stores?

* When you do buy something new, make sure it‚Äôs good quality and designed to last. (There are [guides](https://www.loveyourclothes.org.uk/guides/best-buy-guides) on what to look for when buying specific items of clothing, and tips for caring for them.) Buy clothes with classic silhouettes that you‚Äôre more likely to want to wear in years to come.

* Try to avoid mixed fibre clothes, e.g. something that‚Äôs 55% cotton and 45% polyester, as these are much harder to recycle.

* If you‚Äôre buying something made from cotton, make sure it‚Äôs (certified) organic cotton. [GOTS](https://global-standard.org) certification is probably the best, with multiple [criteria](https://global-standard.org/the-standard/general-description.html) across environmental and social impacts that need to be met. 

* Care for your existing clothing in low-impact ways. Wash at 30oc, try to go longer between washes, line dry rather than tumble dry.

* Learn to [repair](https://www.loveyourclothes.org.uk/care-repair) small issues like a hole or missing button (or hire someone to do it for you.) Extending the life of 50% of clothes by an extra nine months of active use would reduce carbon, water and waste footprints by around [4-10%](https://www.wrap.org.uk/sustainable-textiles/valuing-our-clothes) each. 

* If you're bored of an item, donate it to a charity shop. If it's beyond repair, recycle it.

* Agitate (politely) for change! When you go into a clothing shop ask them if any of their textiles are certified organic, or what % is recycled.

Ultimately however, what is needed is for us to all buy less clothes but be willing to spend more on items that will last.","Got a fantastic book, Wardrobe Crisis, for Christmas and am pretty shocked by its contents"

So they may not necessarily apply to _every_ brand out there.

------------



**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garmented being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn‚Äôt to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it‚Äôs due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they‚Äôre often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it‚Äôs a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it‚Äôs supposed to fit and they aren‚Äôt usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so. I know this isn‚Äôt necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer‚Äôs follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the ‚ÄúPaid Partnership‚Äù feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn‚Äôt. But it‚Äôs actually in both the brand and the influencer‚Äôs interest to avoid Paid Partnerships. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it‚Äôs not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it‚Äôs not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn‚Äôt good for their image or if they have a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track. Furthermore, paid partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It‚Äôs effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

-----------------


**Everyone Copies Everyone‚Ä¶ and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion‚Äôs runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you‚Äôll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand‚Äôs garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul‚Äôs largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

--------------


**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it‚Äôs not because they care about the environment. It‚Äôs because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it‚Äôs because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That‚Äôs not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand‚Äôs DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It‚Äôs worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China‚Äôs factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&amp;M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

Are you interested in making an inventory of your wardrobe? Taking the next step and recording wear counts of items? Going even further into your exploration of personal wardrobe metrics? In this post I‚Äôm going to go over a bunch of different ways you can track your wardrobe inventory and log your item wears or outfits, as well as some things to consider when choosing a method.

I also have links to wardrobe inventory templates I created for Google Sheets and Airtable.

This is a long-ass post, so grab a drink and get comfortable üìö.

# What can you use wardrobe and outfit logging for? üìã

Keeping track of:

* what items you currently have
* how often you wear items (in the long run and short run)
* how much money you spend
* characteristics of your wardrobe (e.g. Do you have mostly spring/summer items? Lots of business casual? What‚Äôs your color palette?)
* what things you have in different locations (e.g. storage)
* view past outfits

Can help with planning and decision making:

* see your whole wardrobe at a glance without having to pile it onto your bed
* concretely plan future outfits
* aid when making packing lists
* smarter shopping ‚Äì identify gaps in your wardrobe and categories that you already have enough (or more than enough!) items for

# Things to consider when choosing a method ü§î

* What do you want to keep track of (i.e. the list of things in the previous section)
* Do you have any long term goals you want to achieve by using wardrobe/outfit logging, like ‚Äúget my wardrobe down to 100 items because I live in a shoebox‚Äù, or ‚Äúwear all my items as evenly as possible‚Äù?
* How much time are you willing to invest up front?
* How much effort do you want to spend on this per day?
* Is collecting metrics important to you? What kinds of metrics? Or are you good with just outfit pics?
* Do you want to be able to track outfits or is wear counts of individual items enough?
* Which of the following characteristics are important to you?

**Ease of use üç∞**

Wardrobe tracking is most helpful when you keep a complete a record as possible of your items and outfits. If something is hard for you to do (either to make time for, physically access, or maybe you find the UI awkward), you‚Äôll be less consistent with it. Also consider how much effort is required to get started, and whether you want it to be easy to update on the go or available without internet access.

**Visualization üîç**

Is it easy to get the info you‚Äôre interested in out of the data you recorded in the method? Are you interested in seeing statistics, charts, outfit photos, or item photos?

**Robustness üí™**

How difficult is it to mess up or lose your data?

**Customization complexity supported üîÄ**

How difficult will it be to add to or modify the types of information you‚Äôre collecting?

**Data portability üöö**

How many ways can you access your information? Is it stuck on a hard copy or a single device?

What happens if you want to switch to another method? Can you migrate your old records easily? At all?

# Accounting Methods

On to some methods! 

## Pen and Paper üìù

Wardrobe tracking doesn‚Äôt need to be complicated. This method is super simple and I feel a little silly explicitly mentioning it, but sometimes it's easy to get caught up in spreadsheets and such: Make a list of your items. Every time you wear one, add a tick mark or the date next to it. As a bonus, over time the tick marks can also become a loose bar graph of wears.

You can get fancier with this if you like (e.g. you could make and print out templates, or do a decorated bullet journal style setup), but this is a low-effort method that can still be effective!

If you love physical notebooks and want to keep it simple with just wear counts, this is for you.

## Digital document üíª

Basically the same as above, but kept track of digitally in your phone‚Äôs native notes app, an app like Evernote, or in a word processing document (handy if you use one that can be edited from a mobile app). If you want the simplest possible digital setup and don‚Äôt care about being able to do any sort of fiddling with the list (like automatic sorting), this is a good option.

It‚Äôs also easy to set up a list on your phone or a google doc, and then if after a while you decide you want to continue with a spreadsheet, you can just paste the data in, instead of having to manually enter it if you‚Äôd started with a physical list.

## Physical methods (hangers) üëñ

A classic and method to answer the question ‚ÄúHave I worn this since X date?‚Äù For items that are hung up, flip all of them so that the hangers are backwards. Record the date. Every time you use an item and then put it back, put the hanger the right side up. For folded items, you can apply the same concept in a way that makes sense in your storage. If you have things folded in a drawer, perhaps put a piece of cardboard in front of each column of items and replace used items in front of it.

There‚Äôs some up front work needed to rearrange your closet, but otherwise this is simple to integrate into your usual routine of getting dressed. It‚Äôs an easy way of answering the ‚Äúwhat do I even wear?‚Äù question, but on the other hand, that‚Äôs the only question it answers as it doesn‚Äôt keep track of number of wears.

After some length of time (one month, six months, a year), you can then take a good hard look at all the untouched items and decide whether it makes sense to keep them. If you want to do this continuously, you can record the wears in a spreadsheet periodically.

A slightly more advanced version of this which I read about on [FFA](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice) involves cutting a standard number of notches in a piece of masking tape which is attached to each hanger. Every time you use an item, you can tear off a notch.

## Spreadsheet üìä

There are lots of ways you can set up a spreadsheet to track your wardrobe, but the simplest setup could just keep a list of total number of wears for an item. You could then add more columns for things like category, brand, color, purchase date, and season and create filter views. Formulas can be used to calculate things like cost per wear and wear rate, and making graphs like charts showing the representation of brands or colors in your wardrobe.

If you‚Äôre up for the extra set up, spreadsheets can be a better option than a plain text list if you want to do more customized number crunching (like keep track of spending, cost per wear, wears per week) and make charts from your data, or want to be able to filter your lists by category for easier viewing. However, it can be annoying to edit these on a phone (e.g. on Excel or Google Sheets mobile apps) so if you think that you won‚Äôt bother to update your sheet regularly then it may be worth either forgoing the bells and whistles and sticking to a basic list, or using a dedicated mobile app.

### Sample Spreadsheet 1: Wardrobe inventory focused on individual item wears

You can view this sample spreadsheet on Google Sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AdBpRuN8znwk58OxMnNS-ZVR8Y5Vdfbwmc7-ZhenN7Q/edit?usp=sharing) and get your own blank copy of it for google sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CHaNZ3SoC6X5h6-dlzeHTnY-afbugxh9KiXMtNYNkac/copy). This one automatically calculates wear counts based on entering individual dates in a separate tab. This is nice because then you can log exactly when things were used, not just how many times. This could be modified into a single tab setup by removing the formula for ‚Äú# Wears‚Äù and just manually incrementing the field.

[screenshot of spreadsheet items tab](https://mgetsdressed.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/screen-shot-2018-09-10-at-12-27-41-pm.png?w=1100) and [wears tab](https://mgetsdressed.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/screen-shot-2018-09-10-at-12-27-16-pm.png?w=1100)

### Sample Spreadsheet 2: Track outfits with Google Forms integration

Someone commented in some other discussion that while spreadsheets are great when you‚Äôre at a computer, one thing that can be an issue with them is that they‚Äôre annoying to update from a phone. Recently I remembered that Google Forms feeds into Google Sheets, so I had a go at updating the original sample spreadsheet to be more mobile-friendly and include outfit tracking instead of tracking each item separately. The following spreadsheet can be viewed **[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rxBY4TUW2umAljhIuWowEX5QHz527tyc6KcragK7Jv0/edit?usp=sharing)**, though the ‚ÄúOutfits‚Äù tab has been unlinked from the original form. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way to share a Google Form so that it can be copied without manually adding collaborators, but the setup is pretty straightforward:

I made a form with fields for

* Date: Forms automatically log the time a form was submitted, but if you‚Äôre going to log outfits at a later date, then that needs to be specified. I made this a required field, but I suppose it doesn‚Äôt need to be.
* Occasion (multiple choice): To categorize the outfit as loungewear, officewear, etc.
* Outfit rating (linear scale): So you can easily find your great or meh outfits for recreating or analyzing your outfit styling later
* Tops / Bottoms / Shoes / etc (checklist with option to write in an item ‚Äúother‚Äù): One question for each clothing category that lists all your items in that category.
* Photo (file upload): I set this to only accept photos and videos. Setting this as a question will upload these to a google drive folder with the same name as your form. You may or may not want this if you‚Äôre already keeping track of your outfit photos somewhere and need the extra space in your Google Drive.
* Notes (paragraph)

I also turned on the option to allow editing responses. Note that a form can also be hooked up to an existing spreadsheet of the right format, so you can make a copy of this sheet and then hook your own form up to it if you want to use this format but don‚Äôt want to retype all the formulas.

You can save the URL to your form as a bookmark on your phone. It basically makes it an app üôÉ

[Album with screenshots and more description](https://imgur.com/a/L9UWNF3)

Because I‚Äôm lazy and didn‚Äôt want to figure out the formulas myself, I used the pivot table feature to pull the average outfit rating of all the outfits that include that item.

This is neat because then you can add other categories as rows and see more granularity of ratings for each item, e.g. average outfit ratings for different combinations of tops and bottoms.

When you add or remove items to your wardrobe, you can then update the form checklists to match.

Some things that could be added to this:

* adding the average outfit rating for the items as a column in the main tab for a category
* making more charts (e.g. outfit ratings over time)
* a tab that shows all the items together. I think there should be a way to do this with the google sheets query API language, but I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to work it out for this example (hence why I personally use Airtable üòõ )
* include more fields for each item like brand, price, color, season, and price per wear

# Dedicated App üì±

If you want to keep track of more complex metrics than a simple wear count, but setting up and maintaining a spreadsheet and charts yourself sounds like the opposite of fun, then using a batteries-included mobile app might be the best method for you. If you‚Äôre primarily interested in a tool to help you with visual outfit planning, then an app is definitely the way to go.

This section could be its own post! There are a lot of comparison articles out there already such as [this one](https://insideoutstyleblog.com/2016/03/readers-favourite-style-and-wardrobe-apps.html) from Inside Out Style Blog (note that it‚Äôs from 2016 and the discussed apps likely have updated some features since then. If you search FFA for ""outfit tracking app"" or ""wardrobe tracking app"" or any of the specific apps, you can find more reviews and discussions) for the proliferation of wardrobe organizing apps.  Some popular and similar ones are **Stylebook** (iOS), **YourCloset** (Android), **Cladwell**, and **SmartCloset** (both).

[The screenshots here](https://imgur.com/a/o4GuNT7) are all from Stylebook, which is the only one I‚Äôve personally tried. I was spurred to try it after Polyvore (may it rest in peace) shut down and I was looking for an easy way to make outfit collages.

**Pros**

* One of the biggest pros of these sorts of apps is that many of them have a collage feature to help you plan outfits, and that you can easily track outfit wears in addition to individual item wears. Seriously, this is great. Don't let the shorter list of pros make you think this is a bad option.
* They also usually have built in features for making neat graphs like what percentage of your closet is which brand, color, etc; lists for most and least worn items.
* They also have lots of cool features like random outfit generators and travel packing lists, and some apps have a community feature where you can share outfits or get styled by other users.
* Nice mobile interface

**Cons**

* The first to consider is that for many of these, there‚Äôs not an easy way to export your data in a way that you can use outside of another instance of the app. Also, if you‚Äôre relying on an app that has external hosting, if the app company shuts it down then you can lose everything (like what happened with Polyvore). On the other hand, with self-contained apps you need to make sure the app is being backed up regularly as part of your phone back ups so if you lose your phone, you won‚Äôt lose months of logging.
* I emailed Stylebook to ask if CSV export was possible or a feature they could add, but their customer support said that they couldn‚Äôt comment on future development and it was not currently possible.
* Another con for Stylebook specifically is that since it‚Äôs not connected to the ~cloud~ (but tbh also a pro, since you don‚Äôt need data/wi-fi at all to use it) you have to manually sync each item and outfit recorded on your app like a savage if you want to use it on multiple devices. Other closet apps exist which are cloud connected. SmartCloset, for example, has an instagram-like feature built into it (iirc).
* There‚Äôs also more overhead to adding items to your virtual closet. At least in Stylebook, the app requires that you have a photo to use for the item at the time you create the record for it. You can always use a placeholder photo and update it later, but if you know you‚Äôll be bugged by not having a clean photo for each item, adding them can be a lot of work, even if you don‚Äôt do your whole wardrobe at once.
* In the same vein, if you know you‚Äôre not going to care about labeling each entry with its size, fabric, color, etc, this option might be unnecessarily heavyweight.
* Some of these apps cost a few bucks.

## Airtable

Airtable is a spreadsheet-database hybrid web and mobile application. If you‚Äôve ever thought ‚Äúspreadsheets are nice, but really they should be relational databases with a nice UI‚Äù, then you‚Äôd probably like Airtable.

**You can view and clone the template I made for this Airtable base (their term for templates) [here](https://airtable.com/universe/expTICh5Zt2uymkG1/wardrobe-inventory-and-outfit-log)**. There are also more details about the base itself there.

I am not partnered with Airtable and do not receive any money for plugging it. I‚Äôm sharing because I have personally found it a very useful service. The free tier of the app I've found usable for personal use as a wardrobe tracker. There are other wardrobe tracking bases available if you search the Airtable Universe, and you can certainly make your own from scratch.

[Here are some screenshots of various parts of the UI](https://imgur.com/a/Vr2jOZv)

Here are some actual views from my own (the UI is richer when it's viewed from the account that created it, though there is still some filtering and sorting options for public views)

* [Gallery of items](https://airtable.com/shrFzlrwtwA2cIV8R/tblQkH8LVsuASOsgh?blocks=hide)
* [Gallery of items I wore in the past 30 days](https://airtable.com/shrPp1AQXEJFxoin1/tblQkH8LVsuASOsgh?blocks=hide)
* [Spreadsheet view of items](https://airtable.com/shrF0c7XKlSodPHXy/tblQkH8LVsuASOsgh?blocks=hide)
* [Gallery view of favorite outfits](https://airtable.com/shrr7UKyKMvik1BHv)

**Pros and cons**

* IMO Airtable‚Äôs main advantage over spreadsheets is in *item* visualization. The UI allows you to easily set different views (multiple filters and grouping on table view, gallery view of photos with customizable tiles). You can also do this in spreadsheets, of course, but I've found it *so* much more pleasant to do in Airtable. Personally one of the features I use the most is checking which items I've worn in the past n days for different categories, and it's much less annoying to switch views than in a spreadsheet.
  * The gallery view isn‚Äôt officially supported on the mobile app, at least on iOS, but you can bookmark links to embed urls to get read-only gallery views in a browser.
  * A visualization con is that graphs and fancier features like pivot tables are only available in the paid tier, so you'd need to export/copy the table you're interested in graphing and do that in another software.
* Its main advantage over an app like Stylebook is customization as well as being able to export data in a non proprietary format. I also like that there‚Äôs a desktop and mobile interface.
* There‚Äôs even an API you can use for free to do [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations on your base and load data into your own scripts for analyzing it.
* There is a limit on the number of records you can have in a single database on the free tier. Depending on how big your wardrobe is, you may need to cut a new base every 2-3 years. Personally I don't find this a con because I don't care how many times I wore that sweater in November of three years ago, nor do I have any goals realted to ultimate wear counts or cost-per-wear all time, but if you're interested in very long term tracking you'll have to cough up (it's currently $120/year, about the cost of a Netflix subscription) or just use a different method.
* If you‚Äôre already familiar with relational databases or complex spreadsheets, Airtable is straightforward to use. If you‚Äôre into DIY, you can basically build your own super duper custom wardrobe tracking app with it. If you aren‚Äôt, they‚Äôve got some pretty thorough documentation as well as a support forum, but for more complex setups the learning curve can be higher than the previously mentioned methods.
* In my experience the Android app, while it technically exists, is so buggy as to be functionally unusable. The iOS app is very usable for data input. I primarily use it in desktop browser when actually analysing things.

Personally, I use Airtable to track my wardrobe. For a few months I used Stylebook (in parallel), but I decided I preferred having the ability to do my own data munging and create more specific views, and that seeing actual outfit photos on myself was more useful than seeing the collages anyway. I still have the app on my phone and use it to make collages if I‚Äôm planning a packing list or for a 10√ó10 challenge though.

If even this is not enough to sate your desire for data collection and display dashboards, there is of course the option of building your own wardrobe management software / webapp. I‚Äôm going to call that as out of the scope of this article üòõ

# Visual Methods

These can be used on their own if you just want a visual record of your items and outfits, or you can combine these with one of the above methods.

## Photo Album üì∏

This is what it sounds like. Take a photo of your outfit every day and/or store stock or original photos of your items for collages. Keep the photos in an album on your phone or computer, and/or back them up on any of Google Drive, Imgur, Pinterest, Instagram, etc. (remember to check that the privacy settings you‚Äôre using aren‚Äôt set to public if that‚Äôs a concern for you). This is possibly the easiest way of getting some form of wardrobe tracking into your life, without any data entry aside from taking photos and filing them into an album.

* You may want to start a new album or board for each new year or season to keep things at a manageable size.
* Instagram and Pinterest are good options because they have options for private accounts/boards, if you like to have your outfit pics and your outfit inspo in the same platform. The ability to create sections in Pinterest and Saved albums and hashtags (I've seen people use very specific ones like #InstagramAccountDressesForWork and #InstagramAccountDressesForPlay to categorize their fits, though this always runs the risk of someone else picking up the hashtag and diluting it) in Instagram are also nice features for sorting through things.
  * If you make a WAYWT Instagram, you can find a lot of FFA-ers with the #redditffa tag.
  * There is the entire can of worms of the social aspect of using Instagram for WAYWT/OOTDs. Having a community built in can be great for moral support, but then there's the whole potential social-media-drain-on-mental-health thing if you make a public account.
* There‚Äôs a great FFA [guide on how to take good outfit photos with your phone here](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2iupe5/taking_outfit_photos_with_your_phone/)

I like seeing all my outfit photos together because it‚Äôs easy to see outfits that I relatively like or dislike, plus it‚Äôs just much more helpful than only keeping flatlay collage images because you can see how fit varies over time, or if colors fade or fabrics get bagged out.

Generally I highly recommend taking outfit photos if you are interested in improving your personal style (whatever that may mean for you) because there‚Äôs really no substitute for having a record of outfits on your own body, and in the long run it‚Äôll make it easier to mentally picture outfits on yourself when choosing outfits or thinking about how a potential purchase would fit into your wardrobe.  

## Paper Dolls

If you loved playing with paper dolls as a kid (or even now!), making a miniature version of your wardrobe can be a fun tactile way to visualize your wardrobe and quickly see different outfit combinations and reveal how versatile items are. This obviously requires a large amount of upfront effort and you may also want to consider just using an app that has a outfit building collage feature.

You can print and cut out small photos (stock photos if you can find them will likely be clearer than any photo you take yourself) of your items to pin or magnetically stick to a calendar each week, or if you feel like exercising your art skills, illustrate them yourself. Zoe Hong‚Äôs channel on YouTube is a great resource for how to render different types of fabrics, although you can certainly still have fun with this with simple doodles. [I did a few of these](https://mgetsdressed.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/rzm96dh.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=1024) once for fun but it's not a project I think makes sense for me at this time, unless it's just for drawing practice.

I first saw this idea from gallow_glass‚Äôs [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/6rvue1/i_thought_ffa_might_like_to_see_how_i/) on FFA. @dressing_dawn went an extra step and [created stickers](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdyxOb7DsuT/) (this is a link to the instagram post about it) of her minimal wardrobe to use in a planning notebook which I thought was super nifty.

# Conclusion and tips

And that's all! If you already track your wardrobe, chime in! I am but one person with one person's experiences. What method(s) do you use, and how have you found it helpful? Do you have any tips for people interested in tracking their wardrobes? **Please note that if you share links to google sheets, your comment will be automatically filtered by automod for approval and not be visible to the subreddit right away, and depending on your settings, your name may be publicly viewable from the sheet**. 

* The #1 takeaway is consistent tracking is best, so choosing the method you‚Äôre most likely to actually stick to is a better strategy than trying to go all out and burning out on it.
* Don't feel like you need to put your entire wardrobe into any of these at once. You can do one section at a time, or simply add individual items as you wear them.
* If you don't want to take photos of your own items, see if you can find the stock photo online, or something similar. It's not like you're going to be selling the item and need 100% accuracy, so as long as it makes sense to you, go for it.
* Try and work this into your routine. Log your outfit at the same time every day. Maybe before you go to bed, or right after you put it on. I log mine on the bus while I commute.
* To motivate yourself, be clear on why you're doing this. Write your reasons down. If you ever feel like tracking is a huge drag and you are no longer getting anything useful out of it, then quit confidently! You can also always downgrade the way you track things to a simple list, or just photos if you started out with a more comprehensive method.
* For spreadsheets or Airtable, consider looking at metrics which are rates in addition to just counts. i.e. if you've had something for 4 years and something for 4 weeks, it's going to take a long time for the new thing to catch up, and that may not feel representative of how much you actually wear them if you just do total wear count vs wears per month. Cost per wear is also a metric many people like to use.
* If you're going to bother with a more intensive method like fancier spreadsheets, schedule some time in periodically to actually look at your damn data. Otherwise you may as well just use a simple list with counts or just keep photos.

Also, yes, this is a pretty big part of how fashion manifests as a hobby of mine, so if you just read all this and are thinking that I‚Äôm way too into wardrobe metrics, you‚Äôre not wrong. To be honest I currently use a combination of Instagram (I like the visuals, editor, and social aspect), Airtable, and google sheets (for making graphs at the end of the year) which for 99% of people is complete overkill. If you have never felt the need to track your item wears or outfits, it certainly is not a requirement because there's no one way to do personal style correctly.",Guide to Wardrobe Tracking and Outfit Logging

For me, my fashion resolution is to find ways to incorporate colors into my wardrobe that I historically have not really worn. In 2019, one of my most worn colors that I had been allergic to in the mid 2010s was brown. When I started caring about how I looked a few years ago, most of those color analysis quizzes said brown was a terrible color for me. But now, I really like warm-toned browns, and I have a burnt-orange corduroy jacket, a pair of cognac brown oxfords and chelsea boots, and a walnut brown belt. My 2020 goal is to do something similar with yellow, which I've typically struggled with in styling on me.

468,femalefashionadvice,"Hello!! 

Always lurked and admired the styles of the people in this sub so I am going to try to be more styles this year. 

I took my clothes my stylish/classic slightly older than me friends and she looked at my wardrobe and said. You have a LOT of black and gray, especially sort of severe shoes because I only wear ‚Äúnice stuff‚Äù to super formal events. I digress.

I have a lot of pieces that can be dressed up or down. She helped me buy like cardigans, and a pair of cream shoes, recommended tights,a few dresses (I am pregnant so pants are hard but I haven‚Äôt changed size much because I was sick at the beginning of my pregnancy and lost 40lbs).

1) I need a wide stretchy belt to give sharp to shapeless dresses. Is this the ‚Äúonly‚Äù option there? How glitzy? I am thinking simple? Black or brown?

2)  I have a pain now of tan/ cream booties, I need basically low or no heel for work, ‚Äúbusiness casual.‚Äù We looked at some fancy sneakers and some flats. I have a pair of Mary Jane type clogs. I need one more pair of work type shoes. I have hiking boots, but they look really used because I wear them a lot and a pair of those tall warm black sorrel suede boots that are almost knee high. 

I don‚Äôt know what color these should be.

My style is classic (because its easy right now), a little bit sporty /preppy (military cut jackets are awesome to me) and western, I live in Colorado.

No bohemian or flowy or flowery or leopard or super vintage. 

If you are still reading this, wow thanks. I would love to see ‚Äúlooks‚Äù and product recommendations. I am happy to post some pictures in an album if that would help.",Help with a styling a loose dress (wide belt) and work shoes ?
469,femalefashionadvice,"**This is the announcement/discussion thread, not the submission thread. Post your outfits in the submission thread on Saturday, not here.**

WAYWT (""What are you wearing today""), but with themes! It's co-ed and hosted by FFA. Share some inspiration photos, float your outfit ideas, and discuss this week's themes here! The goal is to have some fun creating outfits in a slightly more focused way, not to win a contest on Who Can Be The Most Theme.


# Themes for this week are Break a Fashion ""Rule"" and Scarves

## Break a fashion ""rule""

Post an outfit that breaks a fashion ""rule"", because fuck it.

Here are some examples of ""rules"". Not meant to be a comprehensive list. Feel free to add more in the comments!

Some more traditional ones

* Don't wear black with navy or brown
* Don't mix metals
* Match your shoes/bag/belt
* Pink and green should never be seen [together]
* Don't wear white after Labor Day (I always took this to mean ""don't wear white in fall/winter"" but idk)
* Don't belt outerwear unless the belt came with it (e.g. trench coats)
* Legs or cleavage but not both
* Don't wear socks with open toed shoes
* Red touches black, good for Jack, red touches yellow, kills a fellow^(wait no)

## Scarves

Simple enough, wear an outfit with a scarf! Chunky scarves, silk scarves, fine-knit scarves, open knit scarves, little neck scarves a la [Dr. Grant](https://hobbydb-production.s3.amazonaws.com/processed_uploads/subject_photo/subject_photo/image/36263/1516638538-4679-5040/download_large.png).

# FAQ

* **Can I suggest a theme or changes to the schedule?** Of course! Please suggest themes in the theme WAYWT discussion threads and include the full description that will be posted for it. It's great to include some examples, links to inspiration, and things to consider. If you would like to suggest changes to the schedule, you can discuss that there too. *Please do not PM me directly with suggestions.* I get approximately one billion PMs from modqueue stuff, so even if I see your message, the best way to ensure I can actually find it again is to comment in the discussion threads.
* **Do I have to do both themes?** You can do either theme or both themes!
* **Can I submit more than one outfit for a theme?** Yes! If you really dig a theme or just want to share different iterations of an outfit, feel free to share all your photos.
* **Does it have to be something I wore that day?** Not at all! If you have an outfit photo handy from the last couple of weeks that is relevant, you're welcome to post it. But add a note if it isn't recent.
* **Will themes ever repeat?** If you are keen on repeating a theme please suggest that in the Tuesday announcement/discussion thread. If a lot of people also want to try a theme again I'm down to repeat some.
* **Can I use the same outfit in Theme WAYWT and in the regular WAYWT?** Yep!
* **What is ""CCW""?** It means ""Constructive Criticism Welcome"". If you would like to receive CC on your post, you can increase the chances of getting replies by asking for feedback on a specific aspect of your outfit, e.g. ""I'm interested in suggestions for elevating this outfit without the use of jewelry"" or ""I'd like to know if these pants hit at a good spot for this outfit"".","Theme WAYWT Discussion Thread: Break a Fashion ""Rule"" // Scarves"

A long long time ago we used to have a ""Best of WAYWT"" thread at the end of each month/year where everyone's WAYWT upvotes were tallied up and presented in a neat chart, sort of like a reader's digest for users who don't post/follow the weekly threads. While upvotes can be helpful for gauging popularity, I'm more interested in hearing your own thoughts on what worked well this year!

For the purposes of this thread, please post:

* Your best/favorite WAYWT(s) pictures from 2019

* Give a bit of information on why you chose those photos; perhaps you tried something new and it worked spectacularly? Maybe it helped you realize you really love a certain color? Or maybe it really opened your eyes and made you feel more comfortable in your skin than any outfit before? Or maybe you really nailed down that style aesthetic you've been going for in your Pinterest boards?

* Not necessary, but feel free to post your least favorite WAYWT photo as well and talk about it, if you think it might be insightful. Maybe the photo finally made you realize you need to step away from X/Y/Z?",Best of WAYWT 2019: Self-love edition

477,femalefashionadvice,"Yes, I'm giving it a try, again! Hey, I tried to cut down and quit many times before kicking the old Vitamin XXX for real! (Sober 2.5 years and counting) so I've learned---keep trying, eventually it'll ""take"" :)  


I'd love some fresh advice (besides ""accessories!"" and ""clothing swaps!"" although if that's how you'll do it, I won't begrudge you!) on how y'all are making it work in terms of staying excited about your clothes, avoiding that ""I hate everything I need a new wardrobe"" feeling, etc. 

I'm doing a ""cleanse"" in January to kick off a low buy and the biggest struggle I have: 

No amount of guilt trips about the environment or other mental tricks seem to work when it comes to shopping! I think that's because I use shopping as a ""buffer zone"" between work and going home, and as the main attraction in many events because I don't drink. It seems to fill a need that other activities just don't or can't! 

For example, my BF and I went to a mixed-used warehouse that had restaurants, shops, and galleries for an event. He grabbed a cocktail at the immersive event, we had lunch, and then I went shopping. Sure, I could have peeled off without buying anything but... the stuff was so unique, and beautiful! Augh.

So I'm trying to think of both ways I can stay on track AND things that replace shopping (that are not ""working out"" because for me, working out is not a treat or indulgence, heh) I have only one local friend so a leisurely sit and sip coffee is a pretty rare occurrence---I just kinda struggle to make friends, sadly. 

I'm thinking: 

Tapas Tuesday or similar

Meal planning and shopping at my local Fancy Grocery Store

Working on my writing hobby 

TV and movies 

Reading 

Podcasts 

Library and book store visits (books aren't off limits to buy) 

Maybe getting REAL into makeup? I have tons of makeup and maybe practicing using tutorials could be fun? 

Art galleries? I used to be really into this but since I got sober they can be a little triggering if it's opening night with free booze everywhere

I'm not sporty. I don't like working out. My hobbies are pretty solitary and in-doors-y and shopping was one way to get out of the house, mingle, and get some socialization without it being too intense. 

Any ideas welcome! :)","If you are going on a low or no-buy, what are your tips, tricks, and ideas for sticking to it?"

13,femalefashionadvice,"It‚Äôs taken some time and a lot of thought, but I‚Äôve decided that this is the year I turn 25 and this should be the year that I start dressing properly. 

I know absolutely nothing about clothes or fashion, and I‚Äôve always ever bought things simply because they fit. 

I‚Äôve decided that I want to channel a certain aesthetic, something that is ‚Äúme‚Äù versus just a humdrum of old mismatched garbage. I think my aesthetic is naturals - I‚Äôd like everything to be earthy and neutral kind of tones. Think whites, browns, tans, reds (rust), oranges (terracotta), greens (forest), yellows (mustard), etc. and florals! I‚Äôm really big on natural looking florals. 

The problem is, I‚Äôve never done this and I have no idea where or how to start. I think I‚Äôll have to chuck almost everything I currently own out, save for some basics and sentimental pieces. 

Another issue I have is that I‚Äôve gained quite a bit of weight recently, and only a few pieces in my closet fit. I have been going to the gym and eating healthier for the past few months but haven‚Äôt lost a pound. I would like to get rid of the weight but it doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs going anywhere. Should I shop at my current size or wait a couple more weeks/months to see if I can make any progress? What happens if I buy everything at a size 14 now and in six months end up a size 12 or 10?

Would anyone be able to help me with where to start looking for things that will fit my ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù as listed above, ideally somewhere in Australia (as I‚Äôm not a guaranteed size anymore, with my current body shape it‚Äôs really hard to buy online but I‚Äôd be willing to try depending), and ideally places that won‚Äôt rack up a huge bill since I‚Äôll have to be buying quite a bit. I‚Äôd also love some advice on what to buy to start out with during a complete wardrobe revamp. I won‚Äôt need any work clothes as I have a uniform, and I won‚Äôt need anything fancy as I don‚Äôt really go out.

87,femalefashionadvice,"In closing the year, I've spent some time thinking about how I've changed this year and how fashion has been a part of that. 

How did your sense of self as it relates to fashion and style change this year? In what ways do you think you and your style have grown? How has style been a component of your personal growth this year?

Here are some of mine: 

1. I spent a lot of time this year reassessing *how* I thought about fashion and style and understanding *what purposes* they serve in my day to day life and sense of self. Before this year, I thought style was not something worth spending time on and that there was no reason to invest in clothing. I realized that: 1) that's ridiculous because clothes and style are invaluable tools for actively creating the impression of yourself that you want other people to have and 2) they are also great for learning about yourself and actively creating the you that you want yourself to be! 

2. I found that, unlike my past notions, colors are very ""me"". I used to think that colors didn't look good on me, and I wouldn't deign to wear pink. We can talk about the internalized misogyny that probably stemmed created that, but suffice it to say that now I own a hot pink puffer coat and I'm happily the brightest person walking down the street in the dreary winter months. I love it! I love being that person and I love being unapologetically feminine in ways that I never have before. It feels radical to be a scientist wearing full skirts, hot pink, and floral. I've found that embracing femininity has made me feel *powerful* in my field: if you're the only person in the room wearing hot pink, then suddenly it feels a lot easier to speak because you're a lot harder to ignore and *that feels awesome*. 

3. I made it my mission to develop thoughtful opinions and knowledge about clothing, fabrics, shopping practices and brands. I still have a long way to go in this direction, but I think I've been successful at building habits that have enabled me to identify and buy pieces that feel like investments. I've learned to look at fabric content tags, have ideas about what kind of fabric content and proportions I'm looking for and what purpose those proportions and fabrics serve. I've had some success in reducing the number of new garments I've bought made entirely of plastic. I tend to look for garments with a high natural fiber content but also small amounts (2-5%) of (either or both) elastic and polyester/nylon/acrylic as those small amounts seem to make a large difference in how the garment wears over time. I've also had a lot of luck this year with my local Goodwills, and am now on a first name basis with the awesome manager at the one down the street, and have developed a bit of a routine for shopping there. Through this I've got some really unique pieces that I've then been able to take to a tailor to get altered to fit me better and ultimately the cost of the garment+tailor is cheaper than buying new. 

I would love to hear how you guys have grown this year!","How did you, your style, and your fashion philosophy change in 2019?"

89,femalefashionadvice,"One of my resolutions this year is to buy no new clothes. I‚Äôm transitioning to buy *only* secondhand, *only* when something is *needed* and repairing what I already own (learning to sew is a resolution haha).

After I spent 2019 learning about the many abuses and negative impacts of the fashion industry (with an assist from this sub, the book Fashionopolis, and the documentary *The True Cost)* I‚Äôve decided to break the cycle in my own life and make do with what I have and clothing that already exists.

Some of my rules:

-	Exceptions for socks &amp; underwear. I will buy these things new if they are needed.
-	If I want something, I can *only purchase it used or secondhand.* Poshmark &amp; eBay are allowed.
-	Ultimately, the goal is to stop buying as much as possible! So I don‚Äôt want to go from spending money on stores to spending money on Poshmark. I want to stop as much fashion consumption as possible. I will always ask myself if I need something first; if I do, I will only purchase secondhand.
-	Dressing dangerously. That‚Äôs a dramatic way of saying that I‚Äôm going to be more creative in coming up with new looks with my existing wardrobe. I can be bold and fun WITHOUT buying the new trend piece. Although I live in the fashion-less Washington D.C., so doing as little as wearing an animal print is seen as bold and daring lmao.

This is my first time trying anything like this, I hope I can do it! Would love to hear from anyone with the same goal, maybe we can stay in touch and keep each other accountable, offer support, etc.

107,femalefashionadvice,"Rent the Runway sent me a fascinating end of the year email that inspired me so much that I simply had to share my thoughts. They summarized all of my rentals into a fabulous pie chart. I love me some well-visualized data.

&amp;#x200B;

I used Rent the Runway Unlimited service a few months this year. I didn‚Äôt like everything I tried but it did allow me to experiment with new looks, and I think this pie chart represents an aspirational aspect to developing my style. I even purchased a few of the items I loved.  Here‚Äôs a [breakdown of my rentals for better or worse](https://imgur.com/a/PtqYSXS). Since I‚Äôm a huge fan of visualizing data and [I used Stylebook to add some context.](https://imgur.com/a/7J01Dwi) Rent the Runway seems to highlight a difference between things I would rent vs things I would buy to wear frequently. But is the difference really so stark?

&amp;#x200B;

I was quite surprised that my rentals were split between edgy and glam style, neither of which I sought out previously. I consider whimsical styles‚Äîplayful with a hint of spunk, spark, pizzazz, punch. So I wonder if Rent the Runway is detecting that little something extra that I crave in order to make my outfits fun and exciting.

&amp;#x200B;

I love this concept of data analysis so let‚Äôs push it further. Here‚Äôs some of my most worn items according to StyleBook in terms of outfits or individual items. Does this look cohesive with the rentals I chose? Is whimsy actually an offshoot of edgy/glam or am I not quite in tune with the reality of how my style reads? I wonder now, can Stylebook or some other data tool allow a clear view into personal style? Lots of data analytics are starting to get this style thing right. I notice when I find an item on Shopbop it‚Äôs very good at knowing which items I may also like.

&amp;#x200B;

To try to personify Edgy Glam, [I found Micah Giannelli](https://micahgianneli.com/category/outfits/) and with a cursory glance, I love her personal style, so I think RTR is onto something, here. It‚Äôs hard to see myself in this style entirely, but adding that spunky element too something more down-to-earth and somewhat comfortable and practical is probably closer to my nature. I‚Äôd be curious if anyone else received the RTR email or have otherwise attempted to characterize their style in a pie-chart based on reality or aspiration.

Main elements of this album: elements / nature as architecture, magic as mysticism, jewel toned colors, opulence, Northern Lights, folk / traditional Scandinavian magic / patterns, drama / romance, asymmetricality, regal / royal cuts to clothes, rich patterns.

Ways to incorporate this look into every day style: Scandi knits, jewel tones, clothes that seem to work as just as well as art as they do clothes, anything with a Norwegian Persephone vibe (flowing, ethereal in a gothic / dark romantic way). 

Hope y'all enjoy the album! Let me know what you think. I did not go into the Scandinavian patterns (Anna's brown dress at beginning, etc) nearly as much as the high drama / high romance stuff. I would be interested to see a Frozen 2 fashion take from a different aesthetic! Live your Norwegian folk princess truth.

151,femalefashionadvice,"Hi everybody! Newcomer here :) 

I was lamenting to a friend recently about how every pair of underwear I've ever worn gives me a wedgie, and she suggested Hanna Andersson girls' underwear, which her 8-year-old daughter wears. The XL hipsters fit me: they're organic cotton and relatively affordable. A lot of the patterns are very kid-like, and the leg opening is a thick cotton seam instead of elastic so they give a horrible panty line, but I just can't bring myself to care. They're the right amount of loose/tight, breathable, and I can go hours at a time without thinking about underwear and its related discomforts. I do have moments like, *oh no, I need to undress and am wearing the pair with the dolphins jumping over the rainbow,* but for the most part the euphoria of actual comfort makes up for the twinges of embarrassment. 

I've wasted so much time on cute/sexy but (for me) uncomfortable underwear, and it made me think about how empowering it can be to choose for yourself which ways you care about being cute/sexy/fashionable, and which you don't. I think there are a lot of forces (Instagram, capitalism, patriarchy etc) that tell us every choice should be aesthetic in some way, even if the particular style varies.

So anyway that doesn't bother me usually because I don't show in high end stores like that haha! Thought the women's fashion forum might be the most appropriate place to ask, though I'm not super familiar with Reddit.

Except lately myself and the missus have had to.. a lot unfortunately when shopping for something the past few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhoo.. this stereotype, actually kinda holds up! Some places (this is in London by the way) have really lovely staff who seem genuinely nice and totally debunk the idea that posher people are stuffy and stuck up or overly nice in that insincere way that's just grating. 

But.. some places do definitely have staff where you walk in and they look at you and treat you like you've just walked out of jail on the back of a paedo offence. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my question, because I find this perplexing. Where does this snobbery come from? Surely you know you're dealing with high end people who're at that stage of their life more successful than you, generally, financially anyway. And those people may actually be friendly, down to earth, humble and  dressed down to not try to flaunt status etc in your face.

So what is this mindset. Is it something mindless where the staff just isn't thinking at all. They're just really superficial, and thinking, this person isn't dressed up in a Max Mara coat so they're going to be have to deal with my BS!

&amp;#x200B;

Or have they got a more human reason for this snobbery. Are they just on the defensive? Used to dealing with rich irritating people all day so they become like them?

I can find opposite answers on the same website in articles written within a couple weeks of each other.) 

While there's at least been plenty written about spring/summer 2020, I haven't found an analysis of what might come after. I've checked out some of the individual pre fall designer collections that just came out, but haven't found any articles that digested and synthesized them en masse.

A fashion no buy is a period of time in which you spend no money on clothing, accessories or shoes. A fashion low buy is a period of time in which you spend less money on clothing, accessories or shoes. 

**How will it work?**

I will be hosting a no/low buy on FFA from January 1st through March 31st. There will be biweekly discussions posts starting on Thursday, January 2nd. 

**What are the rules?**

*There are no rules.* You can join for as much or as little as you want, and you will create your own guidelines. You are also more than welcome to participate in the biweekly discussions even if you aren‚Äôt currently doing a no/low buy.

Here are some suggestions of what your low/no buy could be but don‚Äôt feel limited to them:

* Buy nothing whatsoever.
* Reduce the *number* of items you buy (such as the [20 in 2020 challenge](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6IweobnvP-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)).
* Reduce the monthly or quarterly *amount* you spend.
* Create a list of what you will need and only purchase those items.
* Only buy from a certain type of retailer such as [not buying new](https://www.instagram.com/notbuyingnew/?hl=en) or only buying from local small businesses.
* For each item you want to buy but don‚Äôt, donate a certain percentage of money to your charity of choice or put a certain amount in a savings account.
* Do something more extreme - [only wear one outfit](https://mymodernmet.com/julia-mooney-one-outfit-100-days-project/) or [don‚Äôt shop at all](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/opinion/sunday/shopping-consumerism.html).

**I want to do this, but I don‚Äôt know how to be successful.**

* Evaluate your current spending habits and create guidelines that are less than your current habits but still attainable. 
* Be clear in your motivation for doing this - Are you trying to save money? Trying to escape [hyperconsumerism](https://blackminimalists.net/blog/the-effects-of-hyper-consumerism)? Trying to be more creative with what you already have? 
* Unsubscribe, unfollow, and mute/hide social media accounts/emails that tempt you.
* If you do find something you want, put it on a list and reevaluate later. Sometimes saying ‚Äúmaybe later‚Äù rather than ‚Äúnot at all‚Äù is enough to satisfy the urge.
* Remember that breaking your rules once (or twice or three times) doesn‚Äôt ruin your entire no/low buy. If you buy something you weren‚Äôt planning on, it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to give up completely.

Before this officially starts in January, let‚Äôs discuss why you will be participating. Why are you wanting to do a low/no buy? What are your goals or motivations?",FFA Low/No Buy: January - March 2020

289,femalefashionadvice,"A while ago I posted about my [slow wardrobe catalogue](https://someusesomewear.wordpress.com/); basically, it's a personal project I started to help me document all the pieces I have in my closet, while journalling feelings, thoughts, and stories associated with each item of clothing. It sounded like a lot of people were interested in doing something similar - my hope would be to collect a bunch our stories into a collective format at some point!

As the new year/decade approaches, I've been thinking more in depth about my style this past year, the things I purchased, and what my style resolutions are for next year. 

Here are some 2019 closet diaries questions I have for FFA (feel free to respond to any or all of these questions):

1. Which piece of clothing best represents your style in 2019?
2. What is your best purchase of 2019? 
3. What is a piece that you're excited to wear next year?

My answers are:

1. A white Exofficio [blouse](https://someusesomewear.wordpress.com/2019/12/17/20-the-adventure-blouse/) that I've worn to an event, work, and on a hike. My style goal in 2019 was to find more versatile pieces that are my style, suit my life needs, and can be worn on adventures.
2. A grey wool Viktor &amp; Rolf [dress](https://someusesomewear.wordpress.com/2019/12/21/21-the-luxury-dress/) I purchased from a consignment store that is beautifully made and I want to keep forever. 
3. My 1930's [wedding dress](https://imgur.com/a/NLDGAA3) that I can't wait to wear and write about!",Closet Diaries: 2019 Year End Reflections

310,femalefashionadvice,"In previous years, the experience of both buying and selling on Poshmark felt worth it to me, because I could easily find a lot of great deals. I also sold clothing I had personally bought for myself and worn on a casual basis. 

When I accounted for the time I spent taking photos, sharing items, answering questions, and packing things up, I made less than $1/hr on the platform, and that was before they raised the fees and shipping costs this year. 

In this last year, I have also observed a large upward shift in prices, so much so that it has often felt like a better deal to go elsewhere or even buy new. 

For example, I saw multiple sellers with Fila Disruptors for $80 while the exact model, size, and color was available from Saks Fifth Avenue for $45 and on Amazon for $50. Even for some of the more competitive priced Fila Disruptors, Poshmark sellers were charging $35, which would be nearly $45 after the fees.

 I would personally rather have a new item for $50 + tax than a used one for $45. 

If you are a seller on Poshmark, are you tracking your time on the platform? If you do track your time and you earn more than $7/hour what are your methods?

If you are a buyer and you feel you get good deals, am I simply trying to buy the wrong types of items on Poshmark? What items in your experience are the best deals for a buyer? 

At what point do you draw the line between buying new and buying secondhand? Do you need to have a discount on a secondhand item for you to prioritize that over new? If so, what percentage off the retail price do you look for? 

Is it reasonable to want to get an item at least 30% off the retail price including the extra fees? That would mean buying a $50 item for $28 or less before shipping and fees or a $100 item for $62 or less before shipping and fees.

* Haven't really tried and layering before? Beginner's guidelines suggestion from MFA [layering help](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/84b2fu/layering_help/) question

&gt; Don't do anything too complicated at first. Start simple.
&gt;
&gt;A couple simple rules are
&gt;
&gt;  1. Go from thin to thick. Generally speaking, thin things over thin things is fine but thick over is not ok. A thin sweater over a shirt works but a sweat shirt under an overshirt is a bit strange.
&gt;
&gt;  2. Keep it simple. Don't go with too many patterns at once. Generally go with 1 at a time. IE a fairisle sweater over a striped shirt is a bit much but a striped shirt under a plain sweater is fine. Same goes for texture and colors though you can play around with that more imo.
&gt;
&gt; If you follow those two rules it should look good. Once you get a bit more comfortable layering go ahead and try to start playing with textures, patterns, and colors. Though I'd stick with going thin to thick.

# FAQ

* **Can I suggest a theme or changes to the schedule?** Of course! Please suggest themes in the theme WAYWT discussion threads and include the full description that will be posted for it. It's great to include some examples, links to inspiration, and things to consider. If you would like to suggest changes to the schedule, you can discuss that there too.
* **Do I have to do both themes?** You can do either theme or both themes!
* **Can I submit more than one outfit for a theme?** Yes! If you really dig a theme or just want to share different iterations of an outfit, feel free to share all your photos.
* **Does it have to be something I wore that day?** Not at all! If you have an outfit photo handy from the last couple of weeks that is relevant, you're welcome to post it. But add a note if it isn't recent.
* **Will themes ever repeat?** If you are keen on repeating a theme please suggest that in the Tuesday announcement/discussion thread. If a lot of people also want to try a theme again I'm down to repeat some.
* **Can I use the same outfit in Theme WAYWT and in the regular WAYWT?** Yep!
* **What is ""CCW""?** It means ""Constructive Criticism Welcome"". If you would like to receive CC on your post, you can increase the chances of getting replies by asking for feedback on a specific aspect of your outfit, e.g. ""I'm interested in advice for elevating this outfit without the use of jewelry"" or ""I'd like to know if these pants hit at a good spot for this outfit"".","Theme WAYWT December 21, 2019: Layering // Shine"

I havent attended many weddings and I am struggling about the protocols and rules I should adhere too. I am attending my boyfriend's friends wedding.

It's being held at a golf resort.

I was hoping to wear this dress:

363,femalefashionadvice,"I‚Äôm sorry if this is a question asked often, but I realized yesterday that I need new pants. I went through to find threads that matched what I needed and I found a few, but they were either older or mentioned that they didn‚Äôt like jeans. I have two identical pairs of Old Navy jeans that I wear nearly everyday, and are really the only pants that I love. I lost a lot of weight last year so I basically just needed something to cover me for a while so I didn‚Äôt have to wear pants that were two sizes too big.

However! That has changed. I‚Äôm a undergrad student, and I have a friend who is VERY into fashion and I‚Äôve been inspired by her to buy more pants. But I don‚Äôt know where to start, because she‚Äôs very tall (5‚Äô11, where I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8), and thin, which is different from my body type. That‚Äôs where you guys come in!

I‚Äôm a size 14, with a curvy body and large thighs, so I need pants to accommodate that. Usually if it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs more billowy and less form fitting in the hips, I find that it‚Äôs not flattering (but I am open to styles like that if you swear by them). I don‚Äôt like pull on pants mostly because they‚Äôre often this stretchy jegging-esque fabric that I can‚Äôt stand. But if they‚Äôre pull on pants that AREN‚ÄôT that fabric, I can deal with them. I usually wear combat boots in the winter, so something that matches well with those type of shoes are best! 

Basically I‚Äôm just looking for some stylish pants that are comfy and casual/business casual, that‚Äôll last me for a while and aren‚Äôt the gross jegging/stretchy fabric (and are flattering for curves). If there‚Äôs any specific styles of pants that you love, or stores that you find that you love to buy pants from, let me know!! Thank you all so much!",Please help: Pants!!

409,femalefashionadvice,"The answer is yes.

The Shape wear is in high demand because of its instant effect on the body size and shape.

It is a piece of cloth providing a thinner and good shape to a particular part of body(Generally Waist, Tummy (Stomach), Breasts, Hips and Thighs). 

When you put on a Tummy Control Shape wear, your belly immediately starts looking flatter than before. But it does not change the belly size on permanent basis. Wearing a shapewear is a good option when you want to look good for yourself and display your figure attractive to others.

**So How does shapewear attempt to make us skinny?**

It makes us skinny by sewing or knitting together elastic or rigid fabrics.Properly fitted undergarments improve your posture, your confidence, and the way you walk, which gives you an all-over sleeker physique.

**We see many video about shapewear that the belly fat is missing after they wear on the waist shaper, so we may wonder where does all of the fat go?**

We've established that shapewear works-it slims, smoothes out lines and what-not, and even supports. With shaper, fat can move into spaces where muscle is compressed, such as the abs. It can also be moved directionally, towards more desirable places. creating the ""muffin top"" look. 

Shapewear is engineered to funnel excess weight to help you appear to be more slim; it can slim you up to 1 to 2 inches, The excess flab is condensed, the same way as when you push your hands on your belly to push in the fat. If the shapewear is well-designed, the fat comes out in a more sexy and appropriate place like your breasts/cleavage and butt

428,femalefashionadvice,"I don't know about you, but in the evolution of your wardrobe, sometimes we are always looking for an improved version of something we have, or we reject things because we can't find it with the features we want.  I was filling out a survey for a new clothing brand and one of the questions was essentially this - tell me about your favorite items and what would make it better.

So as a similar prompt, thinking about your closet or wishlist - what would make it ideal/better for you? 

I have 2 examples that come to mind at the moment.

**\[Floral Blazer\]** I have a floral blazer from Forever21 I got a couple of years ago. It is a drapey polyester, unlined, and boyfriend style. I got it it experiment with a printed blazer. It turns out I love it. So much I paid the same price as the blazer to get it altered to fit better by adding some shape in the torso and shortening the sleeves. 

An improved version for me would offer a higher quality fabric - I love how the one I have doesn't need ironing. so I think moderately wrinkle free would be great. But I'd also want a lining so it would be a little more suitable for the cool Bay Area evenings - the lining would need to be breathable and temperature regulating so it won't be too hot for a warm day. So maybe a washable silk, with silk lining. I'd pick a different floral - more abstract, brighter colors, more watercolor-y. Snf I'd add functional pockets. With a zipper, because blazer pockets tend to be annoying with a modern sized phone. And then it would be perfect. :D

**\[Black Track Pants\]** I recently got these track pants from [Aday](https://www.thisisaday.com/collections/bottoms/products/hail-yes-trackpant) in the wet look material. They are a bit tight in the thigh, which is par for the course for me. I love the fabric on these pants, it is super soft and has nice drape. It is breathable, but also fine if there is a chill in the air - making it versatile for a few seasons. I love the jogger style, and the shiny fabric makes them easier to dress up than other joggers. These pants work for casual, smart casual, travel, and a workout. 

An improved version for me would be a slightly more classic shape/style. This wet look fabric is pretty great, and I am thinking a subtle paper bag waist cigarette pant would be a great alternative. The shiny fabric makes it more dressy and more interesting - but it would still have enough ease for a casual day. Since this fabric is soft and drapey with minimal structure, it would work as a tuck/no tuck waist band.  You'd just need the belt to keep it paper-bag-y. I'd of course update the size to fit my thighs perfectly. I'd make the pockets a little bigger as well and keep the zippers. This would make the pants look more like a dress pant - and suitable in a fancier office. It would be like wearing yoga pants to work, but more polished. 

Tell me about your tweaks to make your favorites better - if you had a magic wand.",What would a better version of your favorite or most wanted article of clothing look like?

WAYWT (""What are you wearing today""), but with themes! It's co-ed and hosted by FFA. Share some inspiration photos, float your outfit ideas, and discuss this week's themes here! The goal is to have some fun creating outfits in a slightly more focused way, not to win a contest on Who Can Be The Most Theme.

# Themes for this week are Layering and Shine

10 house points to anyone who manages to combine the themes

## Layering

* FFA discussion [what is your favorite creative way to layer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/dyqe8g/what_is_your_favorite_creative_way_to_layer/)
* FFA inspo [all the layering](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/afykvl/inspiration_album_all_the_layering/)

* Haven't really tried and layering before? Beginner's guidelines suggestion from MFA [layering help](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/84b2fu/layering_help/) question

&gt; Don't do anything too complicated at first. Start simple.
&gt;
&gt;A couple simple rules are
&gt;
&gt;  1. Go from thin to thick. Generally speaking, thin things over thin things is fine but thick over is not ok. A thin sweater over a shirt works but a sweat shirt under an overshirt is a bit strange.
&gt;
&gt;  2. Keep it simple. Don't go with too many patterns at once. Generally go with 1 at a time. IE a fairisle sweater over a striped shirt is a bit much but a striped shirt under a plain sweater is fine. Same goes for texture and colors though you can play around with that more imo.
&gt;
&gt; If you follow those two rules it should look good. Once you get a bit more comfortable layering go ahead and try to start playing with textures, patterns, and colors. Though I'd stick with going thin to thick.

# FAQ

* **Can I suggest a theme or changes to the schedule?** Of course! Please suggest themes in the theme WAYWT discussion threads and include the full description that will be posted for it.

* **Will themes ever repeat?** If you are keen on repeating a theme please suggest that in the Tuesday announcement/discussion thread. If a lot of people also want to try a theme again I'm down to repeat some.

# Themes for this week are Goth and ""Change 1 Item""

## Goth

There's a whole wide world of goth style out there. Bring an interpretation of your favorite style of gothic fashion.

I've got a lot happening at work this week so I'm going to not drop in a full list of inspo albums but if you search FFA and MFA for ""goth"" (and additionally you can do flair:inspiration) there are a bazillion albums. Some general info and history links:

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fashion) Gothic Fashion
* [Google Arts and Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/pgJyLtCkP9dwJw) Museum at FIT ""Gothic: Dark Glamour"" exhibit (2009)
* [Google Arts and Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/goth-subculture/m03ct3) landing page for ""goth subculture"" has an image gallery and focuses more on the music scene history. Note that from a quick browse it seems to have some nsfw images.

## Change 1 Item

For this one, submit 2 outfits that are the same except for one item (top, shoes, pants, whatever). Change the whole vibe or maybe just make a subtle improvement. Iterate!

1. Choose necklines that are naturally high up -- boat neck anything is almost always going to look great.
2. Wear dresses and skirts that taper in at my waistline
3. Belts, belts, belts

**What I AVOID to Avoid Looking Busty or Frumpy:**

1. Crop tops
2. V-neck anything
3. Wrap dresses (big sob)
4. Camis. I hate camis. They immediately make any outfit look poorly put together on me. I just can't. 
5. T shirts in general. I don't own any t shirts. I always look hideous in them
6. Bat wing anything
7. Crew neck
8. High waisted jeans? I feel like they just accentuate how large my boobs are in relation to my body (maybe because I have a short torso? I don't know, I always look cartoonish in high waisted jeans)
9. Scarves as part of the outfit...it makes my chest puff out more

**HELP ME:**

Because I feel like I often still look frumpy. Outside of my like three favorite dresses, I always look either dumpy OR like I'm all boobs. It doesn't help that people *always* comment on how big they are. It makes me so uncomfortable that people are so comfortable just commenting on my biggest insecurity, but without fail, people always bring it up. *I feel like my entire wardrobe is curated around hiding my boobs, and not about things I like wearing.* How do you balance this? How do you avoid looking busty while maintaining your sense of style?",Busty but Modest-ish!

91,femalefashionadvice,"Hello all,

The recent thread about how it is unwise to wear designer clothes to job interviews got me thinking about my own interview outfit, which is...not great, but I want it to be! I'm lucky to be in academia, and despite being in a less-than-fashionable department, I am within a research area that seems to reward a level of creativity in dress. One of my ""how to get a job in this terrible job market"" books says that the most important thing about academic interview clothes is that they need to fit the formality of where you are interviewing, and they need to be something the interviewee is comfortable in. The author uses the example of her female but nonbinary presenting partner who wore a men's suit to her job interview. It wasn't the typical ""uniform,"" but it expressed her comfort and presentation from the get-go, and she performed better because she wasn't wearing something so outside her typical mode of dressing. Not that we should all interview in jeans, but there's something to be said for sticking with fits and silhouettes that are prevalent in your wardrobe and work for your body made interview appropriate through color and fabric choice and how it is styled.

I'm thinking pieces like [this blazer,](https://www.town-clothes.com/shop/regina-jacket-in-anthracite) [trousers](https://www.town-clothes.com/shop/pontoise-pant-fw19), [suit](https://rachelcomey.com/collections/suiting/products/littoral-blazer?variant=13136917889085).

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of posts about how to wear suits as non-work formalwear, but I want to bring into conversation the spectrum of suits that can be considered work and interview wear for people who aren't in business formal environments and may not have bodies that work with straight cut trousers, 2-3 button blazers, pencil skirts, slim cut pleat trousers, etc.

Brands mentioned in the article as complicit in the subjugation of the Uighur people in China include Adidas, Uniqlo, and H&amp;M. I find this especially troubling because, while some brands like Uniqlo straight up advertise cotton products as coming from Xinjiang, implying that they come from the forced labor factories there, others lie and pretend they don‚Äôt know slave labor is involved. 

Aside from the horrifying treatment these people are facing, they are also terrorized and/or brainwashed into pretending it isn‚Äôt happening or that it isn‚Äôt a problem (see the bit about staged street scenes where Uighur are literally just pretending to walk around like everything is fine) and that gives companies that want to deny the abuse more plausible deniability. Because the Uighur laborers are punished for speaking candidly about the situation, of course an audit will find no one admits to it being slave labor. 

I know Uniqlo especially is a brand FFA likes (I like it too) so I thought this would be a good place to discuss this. It‚Äôs just very insidious, and it really seems like you have to be quite sharp eyed to the origins of clothing if you don‚Äôt want to contribute to human rights violations in the fashion industry.

I have thick hair, but fine strands. It's, shall we say, selectively wavy (some parts of it decide to flip in one direction, some parts of it decide to look wavy, some parts decide to be poofy/frizzy). 

This mop is styled in a shoulder-length blunt lob with lots of chunky layers. I get very regular haircuts to keep it from looking grown-out. I have baby bangs. On a good day it looks similar to [this](https://www.hairstylery.com/wp-content/uploads/hairstyles-with-bangs/18-BkBsQm-BYH8.jpg). On a normal day, it looks like I've been attacked by a flock of deranged birds.

I work out most days of the week and ladies... I SWEAT. I don't get a dainty misting of dew across my face. My hair gets DRENCHED with sweat. I've tried dry shampoo before (and after) the gym, but alas. It doesn't work. There is just too much sweat. So I end up washing my hair almost every day, which I know is bad, but I don't know what my other options are. I can't show up to the office with my hair matted down with sweat.

I also straight up don't have the time (or skill, I absolutely suck at hair styling) to stand in front of the mirror and do flat iron waves or whatever. I don't even usually have the time to blow dry it all the way through - it's so thick, it seemingly never gets dry.

132,femalefashionadvice,"I grew up in poverty and just started working as a lawyer in a small firm. The firm dress code is very laid back: the owner wears T-shirts, cargo shorts, and flip flops in the summer, and now a sweater and khakis or jeans in the winter. He ""dresses up"" to a collared shirt and jeans with tidy loafers if a client is coming in. We only wear suits when going to court or meeting opposing counsel. I've never had a job that wasn't formal (full suit) or minimum-wage uniforms. I've been wearing dress shirts (that I normally paired with a suit) and jeans in the meantime, but now I can actually build a spectrum of outfits for work.   

Since I've usually had 2-3 jobs at any given time, I have almost no personal items other than basics: solid color T-shirts, tank tops, and jeans. I don't have accessories, and layering had always been about staying dry/warm, not looking good. I just honestly don't know what is appropriate for office casual in a law firm. I've asked some former classmates, but they just recommend colors or cuts or stores.  

I'm clueless about *looking like I'm not poor anymore*. I've had a few interactions already where clients and other attorneys think I'm just staff or an intern. Being short doesn't help.

""All of a sudden luggage has become one of the fastest-growing accessory categories,‚Äù explained Beth Goldstein, the fashion footwear and accessories industry analyst at market-research firm NPD Group. While this quote explains that luggage is likely driving any increases in accessories, it doesn't specify how the overall segment is doing. (Ex. Face masks were huge and drove skincare increases at times, but skincare sales were still a small portion of the makeup category.)

Many luggage brands have capitalized on the streetwear hype by collaborating with brands like Supreme, Off White, etc. At a lower, more accessible price point, brands like Away have found similar success by offering limited edition color runs. The appeal of these collabs/colors is the limited availability, similar to sneaker drops. More established brands are following suit - [Dior has launched a collab with Rimowa](https://www.dior.com/en_us/mens-fashion/dior-x-rimowa).

[At Christy's most recent handbag auction, two bags tied for first place wrt price: a crocodile Birkin and a Supreme X LV trunk](https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/supreme-trunk-matches-hermes-birkin-price-to-top-christies-hype-auction-1203396280/). 

To me, this is a way for brands to capitalize on the consumer shift to experiences. People would rather spend money to travel, but they still need something for the insta.

I want to dress more fashionably while still maintaining an effortless/slightly edgy vibe. I also want quality over quantity. I am currently a uni student.

What pieces should I make sure to get? I‚Äôve also never had a proper bag, and I want to think about diversifying the shoe situation (while still being comfortable and feeling like me). I also have no outerwear except for a jean jacket and a puffy jacket. 

Where should I look for these items? I want good quality, durable items that don‚Äôt feel cheap.

I know $750 isn‚Äôt a lot to replace a wardrobe, but it‚Äôs all I have. Please help me turn this into a good thing by making a wardrobe I feel more confident in.

154,femalefashionadvice,"I'll admit I'm new to the shapewear game. I'm a mom of two, and it just makes me feel a little bit more comfortable to wear it.

Here's the thing: I've been looking for shapewear that has **all** of the following:

* shorts
* ""full body"" aka attaches to your shoulders too
* zips/clips/hooks *all the way along the crotch*

All I'm seeing is panty-bottoms (which always leave huge lines on my butt), open-gusset (I can't do this for personal reasons), or just shorts that don't have the top component (which squeezes between my bra and the shorts because I'm 5'11"").

I actually bought a pair of shapewear (Maidenform Wear Your Own Bra Firm-Control Body Shaper which I otherwise LOVE), cut them, and sewed in a line of hook and eyes because I was so desparate, but it bunches and catches when I walk. I really want to find shapewear that has just full-on zipper or whatever on the shorts so that I can unhook them for the bathroom throughout the day and not have to take off all my clothes.

Surely others want this too! Any ideas?","Does shapewear exist that is ""full"" length, shorts, and can be opened from the bottom?!"

157,femalefashionadvice,"Hello all, 
I‚Äôm on an extremely tight budget but will have to build a more professional wardrobe for early next year. There are some objects I have in mind, but moreso vague ideas eg, a new pair of leather boots, a new versatile slim work slack. From what I‚Äôve read on here clothing could be a lot cheaper in January. 

I‚Äôm trying to create a strategy for the few items I need. 

Let‚Äôs say I want a new pair of boots. 
To prepare for post Xmas sales, should I have a list of shoes I‚Äôd be okay with, across price levels? Do I check regularly if they are on sale? 

Should I only have eyes on items and brands  I assume will be on sale soon, at stores with frequent sales? I wouldn‚Äôt worry about GAP having a sale but Madewell, more so.... 

Is there any existing rough list of store sales cycles, to help anticipate? 

The big issue is, how I shop atm is, OH WOW THIS STORE IS HAVING A MEGA SALE. I MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE AND TRY TO FIND SOMETHING THATS ON SALE TO BUY. 

I feel like this strategy (or lack there of?) is a time waster. FFA brains, how do you plan to shop a sale? Do you tend to find one item and hold onto it as a goal for a while? Are you more ‚ÄúGo through 200 listings till I found something I like?‚Äù

161,femalefashionadvice,"**This is the announcement/discussion thread, not the submission thread. Post your outfits in the submission thread on Saturday, not here.**

WAYWT (""What are you wearing today""), but with themes! It's co-ed and hosted by FFA. Share some inspiration photos, float your outfit ideas, and discuss this week's themes here! The goal is to have some fun creating outfits in a slightly more focused way, not to win a contest on Who Can Be The Most Theme.


# Themes for this week are Goth and ""Change 1 Item""

## Goth

There's a whole wide world of goth style out there. Bring an interpretation of your favorite style of gothic fashion.

I've got a lot happening at work this week so I'm going to not drop in a full list of inspo albums but if you search FFA and MFA for ""goth"" (and additionally you can do flair:inspiration) there are a bazillion albums. Some general info and history links:

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fashion) Gothic Fashion
* [Google Arts and Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/pgJyLtCkP9dwJw) Museum at FIT ""Gothic: Dark Glamour"" exhibit (2009)
* [Google Arts and Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/goth-subculture/m03ct3) landing page for ""goth subculture"" has an image gallery and focuses more on the music scene history. Note that from a quick browse it seems to have some nsfw images.

## Change 1 Item

For this one, submit 2 outfits that are the same except for one item (top, shoes, pants, whatever). Change the whole vibe or maybe just make a subtle improvement. Iterate!

# FAQ

* **Will themes ever repeat?** If you are keen on repeating a theme please suggest that in the Tuesday announcement/discussion thread. If a lot of people also want to try a theme again I'm down to repeat some.

184,femalefashionadvice,"Hi all! I know posts surrounding this discussion have existed before, but I wasn't able to find an actual list of stores, so hopefully I am posting this correctly.

I have noticed that brands will make different versions of their items specifically meant to be sold at discount stores. I am sure that many of you already know this, especially in this particular community. 

I first noticed this with Aldo. I had been considering purchasing Aldo's ""Blanchette"" flat (per the recommendation of someone on this sub actually). Around the same time, I was at DSW and noticed that they had what looked like the Blanchette flat, but it was called something different.

Aldo ""Blanchette"" flat -  [https://www.aldoshoes.com/us/en\_US/Women/Footwear/Flats/Loafers/Blanchette/p/12661799](https://www.aldoshoes.com/us/en_US/Women/Footwear/Flats/Loafers/Blanchette/p/12661799) 

Aldo ""Sternatia"" flat at DSW -  [https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/aldo-sternatia-flat/441212?activeColor=004](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/aldo-sternatia-flat/441212?activeColor=004) 

&amp;#x200B;

The second time I noticed this was recently when buying some Vans. The style names listed on Vans' website were different than the style names on DSW's site. Some quick searching led me to this post, which confirmed my suspicions that brands will make different versions of their shoes to be sold at discount stores -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/bid4of/does\_dsw\_only\_sell\_made\_for\_discount\_or\_outlet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/bid4of/does_dsw_only_sell_made_for_discount_or_outlet/) 

&amp;#x200B;

So, in my quest to find ""real"" Vans, I started searching through the popular shoe websites, and kept track of which stores sell the ""real"" style names versus the ""made for discount"" style names. (Also, I know that ""real"" probably isn't the best word to use here, but I'm stumped for what word I can use in place of it.) No surprise here that the ""real"" ones are the stores that don't have sales very often. \*\*I am not sure if ALL brands do this, or just some; I am also not sure if a store will ALWAYS carry the made for discount ones or if it's possible that sometimes they have the real versions.\*\* This list was populated entirely by looking at Vans style names.

\*\*Real\*\*  
The brand's website (ex. [Vans.com](https://Vans.com))  
6pm  
Zappos  
Nordstrom  
Eastbay  
Foot Locker  
Zumiez  
Journeys  
Dick's Sporting Goods  
Tilly's  
PacSun  
Asos  
Need Supply Co  
Von Maur  
Revolve

\*\*Discount\*\*  
DSW  
Kohl's (I wonder if this applies to their big brands that typically are excluded from coupons, like Nike?)  
Famous Footwear  
Shoe Carnival  
Rack Room Shoes  
Academy Sports  
JC Penney  
Hibbett Sports  
Off Broadway Shoes

Nordstrom Rack is a tricky one. They will have the discount versions, but a part of the store's inventory typically comes from its local Nordstrom, so I assume they have a combination.

Obviously this list is catered toward the search I happened to be doing, but I thought I would share anyway in case others found it useful. If anyone is aware of any stores to add to the list, or anything I may have listed incorrectly, let me know and I will edit the post.","List of stores that sell ""made for discount"" versions vs. ""real"" versions"

I was curious into what site/styles/resources were available for an professional woman (stats below).

She is trying to find a style that works for her, both professionally and casually.

She is 50-60 years old, sizes L/XL or 14/16 US.  Her body type falls under the ""square"" look, but she does have a bigger chest (38DD+/E/F).  Her line of work is hospital attributed, so the style needs to be a bit more laid back at times.

Does anyone have any pointers on what I can do about this? I've seriously done my research on the sizing, and even had a great chat and try on with a lady who owned a consignment shop, and we agreed that an M would really best fit me, but apparently it's not! It's such a fitted coat that I'm not sure I know what I can do about it except for to try and find someone who has an S size and swap. The problem is that it's a coat that flew off the shelf in 2013 and never came back, so I'm quite out of luck there...

271,femalefashionadvice,"In two weeks time I have to attend a trade show for my employer (as staff at our stand) and we are supposed to wear a mandatory outfit with the company branding and black Louboutin So Kate stilettos and we will be expected to stand (we are not supposed to be seen sitting down by customers) at our stand during the show hours (10am - 6pm). The good news is that after the trade show we can buy the So Kates at a heavily discounted price so quite happy about that, the not so good news they're definitely pretty painful to stand in due to the narrow toebox and 4.7 inch heel (this is the 120mm heel version as they also come in 100mm as you may know). Two days ago when the shoes arrived I kind of freaked out cause they hurt really bad as little as 5 minutes after i put them on so i was thinking how the heck am I supposed to stand in these for 8+ hours each day during the trade show but after two days of wearing them around the house im a bit more optimistic, i sort of got used to them to some extent and I can last maybe half hour of standing before the pain starts (in college I hardly wore heels at all and since I started working we do have to wear heels and they have to be formal and with a pointed toe but i never went above 3 inches so moving to 4.7 was kind of a big jump i guess plus from what I see online the So Kate's are known for being very painful due to the narrow toebox that squishes your toes together which apparently he does on purpose to make the toe cleavage more 'sexy'...).

Anyways I'll continue wearing them as much as I can during the next two weeks before the trade show so hopefully i can extend the standing without pain period beyond the current 30 minutes but I would be very interested to know if anyone here has any tips about ways to position your feet to distribute weight better and minimize the pain while standing still in them for long time periods.

I've also found on youtube some videos from trade shows / auto shows with models standing in similar footwear and I believe they have to stand in those for similar periods of time as us - I'll link a few short ones below and if anyone wants to have a look and notices any clues in the way they stand / walk in order to distribute weight better and minimize the pain please point them out to me as I'm trying my best to prepare as best i can in these two weeks i have before the trade show..

272,femalefashionadvice,"So when I first started earning my own money and got to choose what I want to wear (growing up in a country with a school uniform and strict parents isn't fun fashionwise) I spent loads of money on random, ill-fitting clothes that looked awfully after one round in a washing machine. 


However, it helped me to develop my own style. I'd describe it as classy - in terms of high quality materials like silk, linen, leather for boots etc, so less polyester and other artificial materials - and more or less timeless because I tend to choose rather shapes and silhouettes that have been around for a while. My colour palette is milky white, beige, pinkish beige, light pink, light blue, dark blue and deep brown. My accessories are almost all gold or rosegold because my skin has a warm hue. 


Now that I know what I really love to wear, I am not afraid to spend more on each of the clothing items. However, when shopping for high quality materials it occurred to me that there are some brands that are probably less known but meet my requirements anyway. 


For example one month ago I bought [these](https://www.vagabond.com/de/AMINA-4203-801-27) shoes on sale for 75‚Ç¨ and was positively surprised how good they were, at least in comparison to some Steve Madden shoes that are in the same price range. 

I am also in love with Uniqlo (I know I'm *really* late on that train) because the pants and the pullover I got are so comfy and nice to the touch.

# Themes for this week are Minimalist and Power Outfit

## Minimalist

Not KonMari minimalist, but outfits low to no embellishment and accessories, in neutral or simple color schemes and uncomplicated shapes. Think stereotypical stark Scandinavian style or Japanese minimalism a la Muji.

* MFA [guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8zbllh/beyond_the_basic_bastard_minimalism/) to minimalist style in a wardrobe
* MFA inspiration [Simplewear](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/7dllj1/simplewear_a_treatise_and_inspiration_album/) One of the rare inspo posts where there is a fair bit of actual discussion in the comments. Regardless of whether you are in the camp of ""isn't that just... basic clothes?"" the OP's interaction in the comments is admirable

## Power Outfit

Not necessarily an [80s power suit](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/70/5e/88705eee2352b402c4c8a1c724d62a89.jpg) (though if you have one, it's certainly fair game), but that outfit that you wear when you need a confidence boost, or when you are really feeling it and want to express that through your clothes. Since this can be more open ended / personal, share a sentence or two on why your look makes you feel like your best self.

# FAQ

* **Can I suggest a theme or changes to the schedule?** Of course! Please suggest themes in the theme WAYWT discussion threads and include the full description that will be posted for it. It's great to include some examples, links to inspiration, and things to consider. If you would like to suggest changes to the schedule, you can discuss that there too.
* **Do I have to do both themes?** You can do either theme or both themes!
* **Can I submit more than one outfit for a theme?** Yes! If you really dig a theme or just want to share different iterations of an outfit, feel free to share all your photos.
* **Does it have to be something I wore that day?** Not at all! If you have an outfit photo handy from the last couple of weeks that is relevant, you're welcome to post it. But add a note if it isn't recent.
* **Will themes ever repeat?** If you are keen on repeating a theme please suggest that in the Tuesday announcement/discussion thread. If a lot of people also want to try a theme again I'm down to repeat some.
* **Can I use the same outfit in Theme WAYWT and in the regular WAYWT?** Yep!
* **What is ""CCW""?** It means ""Constructive Criticism Welcome"". If you would like to receive CC on your post, you can increase the chances of getting replies by asking for feedback on a specific aspect of your outfit, e.g. ""I'm interested in advice for elevating this outfit without the use of jewelry"" or ""I'd like to know if these pants hit at a good spot for this outfit"".","Theme WAYWT December 7, 2019: Minimalist // Power Outfit"

-1 knitted dress, 1 cardigan, 1 dress shirt

-I found out theres a 2nd hand shop in my city, so I bought: 1 leather jacket, 2 button down shirts, 2 blouses

-1 pair of jeans

-1 coctail dress, 1 business dress, 1 blazer

-wedding dress, wedding shoes

-every-day-underwear

368,femalefashionadvice,"So as the title says I'm a trans woman and I bought a 3XL dress from forever 21 and I've worn it in public once before. The only problem with it is that it's a little short. I'm 6 foot 2 so I think it might be even shorter than intended because of my height. The length is fine for when I'm walking around and stuff but when I sit down I feel like if someone was behind me they would be able to see my underwear lol. I don't own any panties I only wear ""men's"" boxer briefs so i also have to roll up the legs of them if i want to wear the dress. 

so my question is if i i were to buy some plus size leggings that were kind of cheap say from walmart would the material be thin? i'm afraid that because of my thighs you still might be able to see my boxers under the leggings if the material stretches in a weird way.

Mostly, I‚Äôve never owned anything leather so am trying to figure out which would hold up better, difference in feel for pants, etc.

Considerations:
1. Cleaning: The faux leather ones I‚Äôm looking at are machine washable on cold, and real leather obviously isn‚Äôt. Would they get smelly (assuming they‚Äôre lined) or otherwise unpleasant if I didn‚Äôt get them dry cleaned?
2. Biking; I bike a lot, ideally would want them to be flexible and hold their shape for me to wear them while biking. If this is unrealistic to both, that‚Äôs ok, but would be good to know!
3. Quality: any considerations that would be helpful?
4. Comfort: I know fake leather doesn‚Äôt breathe, but does leather? W/ pants specifically, obviously. Any other comfort differences?

397,femalefashionadvice,"Hi everyone!

I was wondering if anyone has any tips on quality nylons/tights/etc. 

I feel like many of the tights you buy at the store are designed to wear only 1 time and throw out after. I don't like doing it because it's wasteful and also annoying to have to buy a new pair every time I need them. 

Has anyone ever bought any that held up for a few seasons? 

I recently bought a few tights that are designed for ballerinas, because I am hypothesizing that ballerinas use tights pretty heavily and dont tolerate BS tights that need to be replaced constantly. I only wore them once, and so far so good, but I was looking for some patterned tights. I can only find solid colored ballerina ones.",Does Anyone Have Tips on Finding Quality Nylons?
398,femalefashionadvice,"Hi guys, 

I am BEGGING for help at this point. Nobody in my personal life can help me with my questions. Essentially, I am going to NYC in three weeks and I've been before but it was in late Jan. I froze my absolute butt off so I know I did things wrong. I've done way more research now and I want to make sure I'm on the right track, but mostly want advice on pants and boots and how to style them. Happy to buy things but not spend a whole heap. 

Last time, I wore this beautiful a line coat which stops around my knees. Plain black. And then I'd either wear stockings (leggings/tights) under black jeans with a knit and a few layers underneath it. Then there's the real issue.... 

1) my boots are mid calf. They are proper snow boots like the sorel ones albeit quite nice looking. But I am short. And so occasionally when I'd wear a skirt over the tights, with the boots coming to mid calf, they'd make my legs look shorter. So far my only solution is to wear leg warmers to make the boots like higher, or to wear strictly much shorter and high waisted miniskirts. But I'm hoping for other ideas.

Second question is what pants do I wear? I can't do the black skinny jeans again since I couldn't survive the cold and how constricting It was. I have mom jeans but I want another option. The closest thing i can think to buy is thicker joggers which are fitted and therefore don't look sloppy. But I can find any anywhere...

Thanks if you've gotten this far. I am so overwhelmed and confused and really hoping for help.",Fashion for a short girl in NYC winter!

WAYWT (""What are you wearing today""), but with themes! It's co-ed and hosted by FFA. Share some inspiration photos, float your outfit ideas, and discuss this week's themes here! The goal is to have some fun creating outfits in a slightly more focused way, not to win a contest on Who Can Be The Most Theme.


# Themes for this week are Minimalist and Power Outfit

## Minimalist

Not KonMari minimalist, but outfits low to no embellishment and accessories, in neutral or simple color schemes and uncomplicated shapes. Think stereotypical stark Scandinavian style or Japanese minimalism a la Muji. [Party like it's 2009](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/12/27/18156431/recession-fashion-design-minimalism)!^(I say that facetiously but the article is pretty interesting nonetheless)

* FFA inspiration [Minimal Style + Curves](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/5vfpcm/minimal_style_curves_a_visual_album/)
* MFA [guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8zbllh/beyond_the_basic_bastard_minimalism/) to minimalist style in a wardrobe
* MFA inspiration [Simplewear](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/7dllj1/simplewear_a_treatise_and_inspiration_album/) One of the rare inspo posts where there is a fair bit of actual discussion in the comments. Regardless of whether you are in the camp of ""isn't that just... basic clothes?"" the OP's interaction in the comments is admirable

## Power Outfit

Not necessarily an [80s power suit](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/70/5e/88705eee2352b402c4c8a1c724d62a89.jpg) (though if you have one, it's certainly fair game), but that outfit that you wear when you need a confidence boost, or when you are really feeling it and want to express that through your clothes. Since this can be more open ended / personal, when submitting your picture, share a sentence or two on why your look makes you feel like your best self.

sadly, i purchased them before i lost a good amount of weight, so the waistband bags. in addition to that, the crotch always bags out, making me look like i have a much bigger stomach than i do. i also think the button hole must have ripped wider because the piece of fabric that covers the zipper also sticks out, revealing the zipper and exacerbating the problem. 
i‚Äôm very sad about this, because i love these jeans.
my mom and i are decent seamstresses, but i don‚Äôt know if i am good enough to fix it. i was thinking of bringing it to a tailor, but i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it. i‚Äôm not sure if american eagle jeans last, but mine are over a year old and still in great condition. they‚Äôre made of the ne(x)t level fabric if that makes a difference.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Or I could do red pants from Macy's. I would like the trouser material rather than jeggings style coz I like how it falls. Cannot decide what kind: Cropped with narrow legs , or should it have a flare/bootcut? I will pair it with a button up white chiffon shirt with black pinstripes. Maybe a short white or beige faux leather jacket, and nude block heels.

Please advise.

My wife has known for many years but it wasn‚Äôt actually discussed properly until recently.  All the usual fears and questions have been asked and answered and we are still very much in love. She reluctantly accepts it but doesn‚Äôt want to see me dressed up, which I‚Äôm reluctantly ok about.  

I‚Äôm not reluctantly ok because I want to show off in clothes, but more, I want to have someone to share the fun stuff with, choosing outfits, styles, shopping, just enjoying this additional good part of me.

I dress pretty well as a guy and am happy with my male look, 

The fact is that I just like fashion, female fashion to be precise, as the clothes, style, cuts, textures and patterns are so much nicer and more interesting, not to mention the shoes.. 

We used to really enjoy shopping together as I‚Äôm also a great shopper, helping her out with new looks, clothing styles and shoes, and she looks fashionable and great. 

Despite my years of helping her I have no idea of how to make myself look really good. I‚Äôve managed to get a couple of good outfits together but have suffered more fails with internet shopping and felt embarrassed with shopping on my own IRL than anyone would ever want. It‚Äôs really hard to find clothes that fit or put styles together if you can‚Äôt try them on.

I do understand her not wanting to see me dressed up or try on female clothes however, after everything we‚Äôve been through all I want is some input in to what might look good on me from someone I really trust.

I very much like the whole street style look.  I like casual but stylish, NOT outrageous and flamboyant.. i do ware female jeans (or jeans as they should be known) out and about sometimes but would love to introduce other items into my wardrobe without standing out to much.

The problem is, is that shopping together now feels awkward, I think for both of us, 

I feels like the fun stuff is very one sided and just leaves me feeling empty and rejected.

However the denim jacket is too warm, and I'm just looking for something different.

I am here in love, God does not will that any should perish but for all to come to repentance? This is to answer most objections and to help you understand as God has helped me understand, now I wasn‚Äôt always a Christian, yes unfortunately I used to hate God, steal bikes and cars, commit adultery, beat people up, but God by His amazing grace through Christ saved me. Seek Truth even if it‚Äôs uncomfortable, not pleasure.

In the three most philosophically important categories of epistemology (how we know things), we see that without God we cannot make sense of rationality, our existence, or morality. It makes more sense to say that God is the author of the laws of logic upon which rationality is built. It makes more sense to say that we came into existence by a decision of a supreme being. Finally, it makes more sense to say that absolute morals require an absolute mind.
So, is there a God? Absolutely, because without Him we can't make sense of anything.

God is Holy and in His justice, and because we've sinned against God (ask yourself, have you ever told a lie? Have you ever stolen anything despite its value? Have you ever blasphemed the name of the Lord like saying OMG, have you ever looked with just which is committing adultery in the heart, have you ever hated someone?) He must condemn guilty sinners to Hell. But, God doesn‚Äôt want any to perish, but God is Just and can‚Äôt just forgive guilty sinners, so God in His love and mercy sent His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, which is God manifested in the flesh, God crushed and slaughtered Christ under the wrath of God and judgement we deserved, then Jesus suffered and died for His people‚Äôs sins, was buried and rose again offering salvation to all that repent (turn away from sins) and trust in what He has done. Understand that God is Holy, Just and Perfect and righteous, and we are sinners, who broke His Commandments, but that God provided the Savior. Romans 6:23 says, ‚ÄúFor the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.‚Äù believe in the Lord Jesus Christ we are saved by grace through faith in His blood.
When we repent of our sins and trust fully in the Saviour to rescue us from our own sinfulness, we become new creations! ‚ÄúThe old has gone, the new has come‚Äù (2 Corinthians 5:17)! Along with inheriting our new identity as a Christian, a child of God, an ambassador for the Lord, we are assured a place in Heaven and gain the desire and power to battle sin. Whereas before, we were held captive to sin, utterly powerless and given zero reason even to fight against it, now, we are slaves to Christ and His righteousness (Romans 6:18). This is where true freedom begins!

When we say there is no reason for anything without God, what we mean is that there is no reason for anything. There is no reason to think that 1 + 1 is 2. There is no reason to think anything at all. Everything -- every thought, every sentence, every single word -- is reduced to meaningless nonsense.

The Bible gets it right when it tells us ""the fool says in his heart that there is no God"" (Psalm 14:1, 53:1). We must declare ourselves irrational fools if we declare there is no God. God alone is where human reason can find rational justification.

So why do so many people claim that God does not exist? Or why do so many people claim that there is no evidence for God?
The Bible again has the answer. It says that we as humans often prefer sin over truth (Romans 1:18). We often suppress what we know to be true in favor of falsehood because we prefer the falsehood! The falsehood does not judge us. It does not condemn us. It will not send us to hell. After all, if there is no God, I cannot be justly condemned by anyone! What a wonderful world that would be!
But suppressing the truth of our own moral obligations, and our own failure to live up to them (Romans 3:23), does not actually make those truths go away. One day we will stand before a righteous and just God, and we will have to account for our own disobedience (Matthew 25:32).
Pretending God isn't there will not make Him go away. It will only lead to an eternity of regret.

Unfortunately we live in a corrupt society that intuitively knows God exists (through intelligent design, order, conscience, objective morality, sense of justice) but suppress the truth in unrighteousness, people tend to not like what goes against their pleasures unfortunately Despite all the evidence too. (24,000 manuscripts, 9 ancient sources, 500+ eyewitnesses, historical scholars and professors know this to be true as well, above all the word of God.) Recieve the Lord Jesus Christ death burial and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins by repentance and faith, would you rather live a lifestyle of sin and be condemned or receive eternal life God offers as a gift by His amazing grace through the Lord Jesus Christ.

Repentance is to reject your old sinful ways of living and make a 180-turn towards God and His good, righteous character/statutes. It means we feel the weight of our guilt before God and respond by sincerely apologizing for our wickedness, thanking Him for His pardon through the blood of Jesus, and living the rest of our lives to please Him ‚Äî and Him alone. Trusting alone in Christ knowing no amount of good deeds can save you, and following Him loving the Lord thy God being obedient, faithful and enduring till the end. There will be trials and tribulations, but it is for our benefit! Humble yourself.

This view [that Jesus didn‚Äôt exist] is demonstrably false. It is fuelled by a regrettable form of atheist prejudice, which holds all the main primary sources, and Christian people, in contempt. ‚Ä¶. Most of its proponents are also extraordinarily incompetent.

Maurice Casey, Nottingham University, in Jesus of Nazareth

Today, nearly all historians, whether Christians or not, accept that Jesus existed and that the gospels contain plenty of valuable evidence which has to be weighed and assessed critically.

The late Graham Stanton, Cambridge University, in The Gospels and Jesus

The Bible is a reliable collection of historical documents written by eyewitnesses during the lifetime of other eyewitnesses which report supernatural events in fulfillment of specific prophecies claiming that they are words of divine origin, rather than human in origin.""    derived from 2 Peter 1:16-21

C.S. Lewis on Reasoning to Atheism
‚Äé‚ÄùSupposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It‚Äôs like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can‚Äôt trust my own thinking, of course I can‚Äôt trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.‚Äù

When you say there's too much evil in this world you assume there's good. When you assume there's good, you assume there's such a thing as a moral law on the basis of which to differentiate between good and evil. But if you assume a moral law, you must posit a moral Law Giver, but that's Who you're trying to disprove and not prove. Because if there's no moral Law Giver, there's no moral law. If there's no moral law, there's no good. If there's no good, there's no evil. What is your question?

I know that Acrylic is known to be cheap and retains odours and doesn‚Äôt last long, that polyester alone is not quite good either and that cotton and wool were good materials and worth its price..but here are my questions:

I was wondering if any acrylic blends would still be worth it (say 60% cotton 40% acrylic)? 

Also I heard that its better if the sweater doesnt contain too many fabrics.. what are some good blend ratios? Like how much is too much polyester in a poly/cotton blend

Does the 7% of wool actually improve the sweaters quality (hm sweaters often have a blend of cotton polyester and a small percentage of wool)?

I am thinking of trying one out after 2 years of a ‚Äòbuy nothing new‚Äô streak.

I just want to learn to stop hunting for new things and be happy with what I have.


**Review of my two years of buy nothing new:**


When I first started, I was working part time and going to school part-time.  I had a lots of time and was able to find a lot of cool stuff.  The thrift store near me does half-priced Mondays, and I happened to have time to shop on that day.  Also, I was working high-level retail sales the previous year so I had lots of cool stuff(75% discount with 1 free item per month).  Once my cohort started, I had like zero time/energy to shop and stuck with poshmark since I was so focused on academic achievement.  First year, since I had more time I spent more(around $330/20 items), but all of those were low cost buys.  With poshmark, I spent more per piece, but less over all($173/6 items) Now that I am working, I have the time but I also wear a uniform to work so its not like I really need to have any new stuff.  So I thought I would try to level up challenge wise and try a buy-no period out.",No-Buy/Low-Buy/Buy-Nothing new 2020

Turns out using a [specific type of washing bag](https://www.patagonia.com/product/guppyfriend-washing-bag/4031874016381.html) can act as a filter for these plastics. I'm sure there are cheaper ones, but i trust Patagonia's guppy bag. Anyway, seems like a small price to pay overall!

21,femalefashionadvice,"I feel like this is a pretty neglected subject that took me a while to handle. I have ADHD and because of that, I'm very particular about my clothing. I'm not on the autistic spectrum, so I can't speak for their experiences, but our symptoms often overlap so I personally would love to hear some of their tips. Everyone's experiences are different, and these are just the things that help me, if you do the opposite and it helps you, awesome! But here are some tips I've picked up and if you have any I'd love to hear them! If someone you love has any of these conditions, you could read this too! It might help you know what to avoid when buying them a present. 

\- Only buy soft fabrics! I don't purchase anything if the fabric is going to make me uncomfortable. To make sure, I'll touch it to my forearms because thats what usually bothers me the most.

\- Avoid super bright colours and patterns. I don't know if this affects any other ADHD people, but wearing a loud pattern or colour makes me so uncomfortable and on edge. It can be pretty hard to explain, but it almost makes me too excited. If you feel like the outfit is too boring, I find that if the pattern/bright colour is on the shoes it doesn't bother me too much. But generally I like to stick to simple colors and patterns.

\- Keep your outfits simple. If I have a bunch of accessories and coats and layers, I will lose something eventually. Because of this I try to pare down the amount of clothing I wear. I've lost so many scarves and gloves and hats because I'm just so prone to leaving things everywhere.

\- This is more specifically related to ADHD but because of the impulsivity, I often buy things on an impulse. Because of this, I limit my shopping online, and only purchase something after I read the reviews (if applicable), it serves a purpose in my closet, and ask a close friend if they think I would get use out of it. This has prevented my closet from tripling in size!

\- Along with that, frequently take a look at your closet to make sure that you use everything. Sometimes it can be overwhelming to make a choice. To help with this, I set out my clothes the night before, but it helps to reduce the stress by only having things I like a lot!

\- DON'T BUY SUPER RIPPED JEANS. This may not be for everyone, but if I purchase super ripped jeans or any type of very distressed clothing, I will pick at it and ruin it. I've just had to learn that minimally distressed clothing, if at all, is the way to go.

\- Wear rings! This may not be for everyone, but if you stim, rings are a very fun way to do it. I find it's not distracting to others like using a pen or a toy can be. You could use a necklace too, but I like rings more!

\- Express yourself! I used fashion for a long time to cope. ADHD brought so many emotional issues and low self esteem, and there's really something magical the confidence an outfit you love and give you.

Chanel is one of the most recognizable luxury brands and for many women purchasing a Chanel handbag is on their must-have list of purses to add to their collection.¬†

Although these handbags are much sought-after, Chanel bags are some of the most expensive on the market and as a result, can lead many women away from retail stores and instead search for these items on the secondary market (i.e. consignment stores). However, as with Louis Vuitton or other popular luxury designer brands, Chanel handbags are often faked as well. Therefore when deciding to purchase a vintage or pre-loved bag you should be careful when evaluating the purse you would like to acquire.

Here at Trendful, we consider authenticity our highest priority in creating a seamless shopping experience for our customers!¬†

**To help you better understand how to authenticate Chanel handbags we have created this guide!**¬†

**Leather**

Chanel handbags typically can be found in lambskin leather which should feel buttery soft or calfskin leather, otherwise more widely known as Chanel Caviar leather, which should have a pebbled, or grained texture.

Things to consider when choosing a Chanel handbag are that the calfskin leather is more prone to scratches, however, on the other hand, the lambskin leather can be more difficult to clean if it were to get dirty. Click **here** to read about how to take care of your Chanel leather handbags.

Chanel handbags can also come in patent leather, silk, and suede so don‚Äôt think that just because the purse isn‚Äôt in lambskin or calfskin that the bag is not authentic.

**Logo**

The Chanel logo is iconic and is typically one of the first things that women look for when authenticating a bag. It was actually Karl Lagerfeld in the 1980s who first created the iconic overlapping C-lock. Make sure that when purchasing a handbag that the right C overlaps at the top and the left C overlaps at the bottom.

Once you open the purse the back of the lock plate should have flat head screws (there should never be Phillips head screws) and it should also be stamped in all-caps CHANEL / PARIS.

**Stitching**

The quality of the stitching of Chanel handbags is a very important aspect to evaluate when purchasing a vintage or pre-loved Chanel bag. The quilted Chanel bags have a very high stitch count, typically around 11 stitches per side of each diamond. The high stitch count allows for a quilted look without looking too puffy.

Things to consider, with the diamond design the stitches should align perfectly and there should be no missed stitches or uneven seams.

**Hardware**

Chanel hardware is always of great quality, and actually, up until 2008, the hardware was done in 24k plated gold.

The hardware should be in a heavy high-quality material, you will never see a Chanel purse with plastic or cheap metal hardware. That being said the hardware on authentic handbags can still show wear and tear depending on the age and overall condition of the bag.

**Date Codes/Authenticity Cards**

In the 1980s Chanel created its own coding system for their handbags. Before 1984 Chanel did not use any kind of coding system, therefore, if you have a vintage handbag pre-1984 you will not find a serial number inside the purse. However, in some cases, the sticker with the serial number can be missing or end up peeled off due to wear.¬†

\-From 1984-1986 the serial number must have 6 digits.

\-From 1987-2004 the serial number must have 7 digits.

\-From 2005-present the serial number must have 8 digits.

Click **here** to see our in-depth guide to Chanel serial numbers.

If you were to purchase a Chanel handbag from a retail store, included in your purchase would be a Chanel authenticity card (unlike Louis Vuitton handbags which do not include authenticity cards). The authenticity cards were introduced in the 1980s at the same time as the serial number dating code system. However, keep in mind that fake handbags can come with fake authenticity cards as well.¬†

\-the card should feel sturdy like a credit card.

\-the number on the card should match the serial number on the sticker inside the bag.

\-from 2005-present on the card should include a light-gray circular symbol.

But don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt have an authenticity card, often times the cards can become easily lost.¬†

**Zippers**

Another aspect of Chanel handbags to evaluate before purchasing are the zippers. Chanel has used a variety of different zippers on their purses, including Lampo, EP, OPTI DMC, √©clair, DMC, and YKK. Additionally, zippers can have CHANEL or three Cs in a circle and sometimes with vintage handbags zippers can be unmarked.

**Stamps/Embossing**

Once you open a Chanel you should look closely at the logo at the interior. The logo should not just sit on top of the leather, it should be embossed into the leather.¬†

Another thing to consider is that the color of the interior stamp should match the exterior hardware (i.e. gold hardware should correlate to gold interior stamping).

**Lining**

An authentic Chanel handbag‚Äôs interior lining should be pulled tightly to the walls of the purse and should lay flatly with no bumps or bubbles.¬†

Purchasing a Chanel handbag can be a daunting experience, especially if you are purchasing online where you can‚Äôt touch and see in person the item. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions or for more pictures of the bag you are coveting.¬†

Happy Shopping!¬†

XOXO

# Themes for this week are Style Mash-up and Cozy

## [Style Mash-up](https://i.imgur.com/s4eamxv.jpg)

Of course, descriptors like ""grunge"", ""prep"", ""bohemian"", etc are all constructed and *any* style can be its own thing. But, just for fun, share one outfit that combines two distinct styles. They don't have to be generally acknowledged ones ‚Äì if it's two styles that you've come up with, just share examples/a description of each. 

In my search for related discussion threads and inspo albums, I found that most of the questions were more focused on combining styles within a wardrobe (not a one-off outfit) and most of the replies were something along the lines of ""don't sweat it"" rather than specific tips or suggestions. If you're having trouble coming up with a combo look that you like, some things to consider are

* limit the color palette
* instead of just splitting the difference in each outfit half, for example if you have style A on top and B on bottom, try changing it so the shoes are style A, or add an accessory somewhere in the top part in style B
* in that vein, perhaps do a more versatile base with one or more items clearly from style A, and have accessories/hair/makeup or outerwear from style B
* If 50-50 isn't happening, mostly style A but with a clear flair of B works too!

## [Cozy](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/26/e3/4026e33353b5c91bd0023cfd555d32c3.jpg)

Instead of seeing how under-the-radar you can get with your ""office pajamas"", lean in to that hygge / Big Lebowski aesthetic. Pile on the fleece-lined joggers, fuzzy socks, flannels, big sweaters, beanies, and blanket scarves!

73,femalefashionadvice,"Hello, I don't see these kind of posts here but I through you guys could give me a bit of help, very much open for suggestions!

I'm 35F, and my fingers are quite thick/chubby (partially weight, partially genetics, since my mom also has large hands me and is much thinner). I only recently got into proper jewelry when I was gifted a piece made by Polly Wales. 

https://imgur.com/a/ZwpTMeO

I sometimes accessorize for my outfit of the day, but honestly usually go for something I just have it on all the time, or that is very comfortable to have it on and not have to give it so much though.

I love the design of the thin bands and such, but I have concluded they just don't look good on me (and are not so comfortable!). I recently tried on an absurdly expensive and beautiful Polly Wales skull ring and I loved the proportions so much on my hand! (you can see it in the photo album). I really would like to find other rings that might achieve a similar harmony in my hand.

I have had some luck searching on Etsy for ""shield"" rings (through some of them are still just thin bands with something large on top). Broad and Thick mainly turn up those plain boho rings which I'm not a huge fan of.

Any term I should be looking out for when searching? Any other advice for what might suit my hand?

I have a hard time pin pointing my style, I love wearing bold fashion but also highly prioritise comfort and since I'm not skinny nor have big breasts, kinda have to come up with my own styling (so hard finding instagram accounts of people with similar bodies to mine to get inspiration!)",Advice for rings that would suit thick fingers

So my feet (the longest one with socks at the end of the day)  are 24 cm long ; the shoe size that works for me usually is  UK5.5 or EU38.5. Firstly, 24 cm size isn't even an available option for the shoes I want; they only have 23.5 and 24.5 cms as options:

1. 23.5 cm foot --&gt; UK 5 --&gt; US7--&gt;EU38 
2. 24.5 cm foot --&gt; UK6--&gt;US8--&gt; EU39

Hey

So I'm male/18, in first year of university. I usually just wear tracksuit bottoms (navy, very clean, actually quite nice) and a grey hoodie. I know it sounds bad, but it's very clean and looks nice. I never really wear jeans to uni or fancy coats, etc. Do girls dislike this? Should I be wearing clothing that is more interesting? Such as Christmas jumpers at this time of the year?

137,femalefashionadvice,"To give some context to my question I moved 6 months ago from Colorado to Maryland for a new job. I'm used to being a bit more casual even when going to a big event. My company has a MAJOR milestone anniversary coming at the first of the year. They are holding a gala for the employees in downtown Washington, DC. I don't have the details yet, but given the area, I'm expecting it to be more formal if not a black-tie event. 

I am also a plus-size woman who has never really cared a whole lot about fashion. I like looking at pretty things, but I have never really been fashion-conscious. I've been already looking and budgeting at what I might need to spend on a dress and getting ideas of what might look good. I've looked at Rent The Runway a bit, but I go back and forth on liking styles.

I found this dress:  [https://www.etsy.com/listing/629208163/tdy-plus-size-ombre-purple-bridesmaid?ref=shop\_home\_active\_47](https://www.etsy.com/listing/629208163/tdy-plus-size-ombre-purple-bridesmaid?ref=shop_home_active_47) 

Would this be appropriate for a black-tie event? I know it's intended more like a bridesmaid dress, but I love the ombre coloring of the dress. It makes it look a bit different from other dresses in that style that are a solid color.

Before I get my heart set on this I need to know the details of the party, certainly. I would also appreciate feedback if anyone thinks this wouldn't work.",Fashion Advice Needed - Company Gala in January

So, I'm a guy. I know nothing about bags. 

I was originally going to try to buy a 100% Made in Brazil handbag for a good Brazilian family friend, but I now feel like there's too much room to make a mistake and get one she doesn't like. So, I think a Made in Brazil ""clutch"" bag might be safer.

167,femalefashionadvice,"Despite being a \~millenial/gen-z cusp\~ I've felt mostly out of the loop on gen-z styles. At first glance it's all over the place. The first time I saw GenZ streetwear I was confused ! I've never been one to think that fashion had specific rules, but if it did, I thought Gen Z broke them. Tiny sunglasses?? Fuzzy bucket hats? Side cut-out pants?? Where did these things even come from? I'd always thought fashion moved slowly, the skinny jean led to the straight jean and then the wide leg. Athleisure basics to minimalism, etc. But Gen Z, similar to leading their own charge on social issues has done the same thing with fashion. Yes, the 90s trends gave way to the early 2000s heavily inspired trends but aside from that, Gen Z style is uniquely influenced by each other with each trend playing off of and trying to one-up the other for clout. It's madness! It's equal parts offputting yet so so exciting.

Enter Euphoria, which if you haven't watched yet please do! It's your not so typical typical high school drama, except on HBO so basically more sex and drugs and better cinematography. Like Gen Z fashion, this show put me off a bit at first. Certain parts of it still do, but thats another post for another day. As I watched through more of it I've come to appreciate that every character's story is relatable in some way. So while I've never been a dominatrix cam girl for a rich 60 yr old man, been in rehab by age 15, or framed someone for a crime, I have been a teen wanting to explore my pent up sexuality built up by Tumblr fan fiction, been so depressed I couldn't get out of bed, and been willing to do anything for someone in a toxic relationship.

But even if the story doesn't appeal to you, honestly you could watch Euphoria solely for the fashion and makeup and you still wouldn't be bored of it. Each of these inspo albums is centered around a different character in the show. Despite them all having their own distinct looks, some overlapping with others more (Jules/Maddy), together they capture the current energy of gen-Z fashion. Though sometimes derivative of the era of inspiration (eg 2010s streetwear, early 2000s mainstream) I think the show uniquely encapsulates gen z and its fashion in all of its euphoria.

[Rue](https://imgur.com/a/RNyHdma) \- the heroine of our story - Fresh out of rehab in the beginning of the series, Rue spends the season just trying to keep it together, fall in love, look out for her sister and stay sober. Definitely the least showoffy of the rest of these characters in terms of fashion and for good reason. Who's gonna put together a crazy eye makeup look when you're just trying to muster up the energy to get out of bed? Rue is our effortless streetwear queen. words: prints, tomboy, no fitted fits here, stolen from dad's closet

[Jules](https://imgur.com/a/dR6N9Xz) \- Obliterating femininity - Towards the end of the season Jules talks about how she wants to conquer femininity through her relationships with men. When her friend asks her if she's done that yet, she corrects herself. Not only does she want to conquer it, she wants to obliterate it. This dichotomy of needing to work within the construct of femininity while also trying to destroy it comes across in her fashion. She takes these stereotypical feminine trends like the color pink or glitter and makes them her own. words - shimmer, transparency, layers on layers, romantic, quirky

[Kat](https://imgur.com/a/MhenGSc) \[note this album may contain some images NSFW\]- ""There's nothing more powerful than a fat girl who doesn't give a fuck"" - Early on in the show Kat changes her look and her demeanor from introverted tumblr fanfic blogger to literal dominatrix cam girl. Her confidence is bursting from the seams of her clothes. Like with her sexuality, she's using her clothing as a way to stand out and express that newfound confidence. Throughout the season she struggles with balancing this dgaf attitude about sex with staying true to her own heart. No spoilers, but now that it seems she's realizing she needs this balance, I wonder if in the next season we'll see her stray away from some of her accessories like the body harnesses. words - high school but make it bdsm, latex, showoff, edges and curves

[Maddy](https://imgur.com/a/CQMfwC6) \- ""the hottest most confident bad bitch version"" - Maddy and Jules are like two ends of the spectrum of their relationship with and ways of expressing their femininity. whereas jules is like ready to charge into the battle of gender constructs with her looks, Maddy is ready to die on the hill of being the hottest, baddest Woman with a capital W. i like to think of Maddy and her style as the hottest, most confident, bad bitch version of the typical Hot Girl in teen romcoms. words - sleeveage ( is this a word?) , cleavage, bored of fashionnova, femme fatale

WAYWT (""What are you wearing today""), but with themes! It's co-ed and hosted by FFA. Share some inspiration photos, float your outfit ideas, and discuss this week's themes here! The goal is to have some fun creating outfits in a slightly more focused way, not to win a contest on Who Can Be The Most Theme.


# Themes for this week are Style Mash-up and Cozy

## [Style Mash-up](https://i.imgur.com/s4eamxv.jpg)

Of course, descriptors like ""grunge"", ""prep"", ""bohemian"", etc are all constructed and *any* style can be its own thing. But, just for fun, share one outfit that combines two distinct styles. They don't have to be generally acknowledged ones ‚Äì if it's two styles that you've come up with, just share examples/a description of each. 

In my search for related discussion threads and inspo albums, I found that most of the questions were more focused on combining styles within a wardrobe (not a one-off outfit) and most of the replies were something along the lines of ""don't sweat it"" rather than specific tips or suggestions. If you're having trouble coming up with a combo look that you like, some things to consider are

* limit the color palette
* instead of just splitting the difference in each outfit half, for example if you have style A on top and B on bottom, try changing it so the shoes are style A, or add an accessory somewhere in the top part in style B
* in that vein, perhaps do a more versatile base with one or more items clearly from style A, and have accessories/hair/makeup or outerwear from style B
* If 50-50 isn't happening, mostly style A but with a clear flair of B works too!

If you have any other tips for this, please share in the comments! [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/bj6xlx/venn_diagrams_list_three_core_pieces_from_your/) from FFA where users described ""venn diagram"" outfits might be a good place to get some ideas going (though it was more of a fantasy exercise and there aren't really any photos in the thread). Or any specific inspo albums which combine two aesthetics. The only one I could recall was [Bitch, you owe me a tulle skirt](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/7qbvf4/bitch_you_owe_me_a_tulle_skirt_an_inspiration/) on FFA which combines a super girly look with punk.

# FAQ

* **Can I suggest a theme or changes to the schedule?** Of course! Please suggest themes in the theme WAYWT discussion threads and include the full description that will be posted for it. It's great to include some examples, links to inspiration, and things to consider. If you would like to suggest changes to the schedule, you can discuss that there too.
* **Do I have to do both themes?** You can do either theme or both themes!
* **Can I submit more than one outfit for a theme?** Yes! If you really dig a theme or just want to share different iterations of an outfit, feel free to share all your photos.
* **Does it have to be something I wore that day?** Not at all! If you have an outfit photo handy from the last couple of weeks that is relevant, you're welcome to post it. But add a note if it isn't recent.
* **Will themes ever repeat?** If you are keen on repeating a theme please suggest that in the Tuesday announcement/discussion thread. If a lot of people also want to try a theme again I'm down to repeat some.
* **Can I use the same outfit in Theme WAYWT and in the regular WAYWT?** Yep!
* **What is ""CCW""?** It means ""Constructive Criticism Welcome"". If you would like to receive CC on your post, you can increase the chances of getting replies by asking for feedback on a specific aspect of your outfit, e.g. ""I'm interested in advice for elevating this outfit without the use of jewelry"" or ""I'd like to know if these pants hit at a good spot for this outfit"".",Theme WAYWT Discussion Thread: Style Mash-up // Cozy
202,femalefashionadvice,"Posting as a throwaway account because this is reddit and people like to downvote this kind of stuff sometimes. 

In the past year or two, I‚Äôve noticed an uptick in comments about the types of brands recommended or discussed at the fast fashion **and** higher end level. Vocal posters at each extreme seem to 1) get sanctimonious about fast fashion as if the people who buy it are immoral/don‚Äôt care about the planet, or 2) get snarky about pricier ethical/luxury brands as if the people who buy it do so to make them feel bad about their less expensive choices/financial circumstances. 

Fashion encompasses a range of brands and price points. I don‚Äôt understand why fast, ethical, and luxury fashion can‚Äôt be discussed without snark or sanctimony ‚Äì or attempts to make other members feel bad that they can‚Äôt afford **or** can afford certain types of clothes.

223,femalefashionadvice,"I'm back on the job market unexpectedly and of course I have just dyed my hair deep teal. 

This will be a really hard color to cover up so I'd have to go black probably, which means I would thrash my hair if I wanted to color it any other color (i.e. I'd be stuck with black for a bit). The styling and color isn't super in your face, and I don't have visible tattoos or piercings, nor a punk/alternative look overall, but I'm in a position where I'm actively and somewhat urgently job searching, so...

I'm 40 and mid-career and would be interviewing for positions across the board from retail manager to non-customer-facing office jobs in learning and development in start ups or small biz. I'm in a ""big city"" type place, not a conservative small town, and unnatural hair is pretty popular here. 

I'm torn. On one hand, I don't really want to work a job where subtle unnatural hair is a problem. On the other, I need a job and I'm not really in a strong position to be that picky.

238,femalefashionadvice,"Since the end of 2019 is coming, I've been reviewing my expenditures for the year and I'm curious how much everyone else spends on their wardrobe? For this year, I've spent about $1800 so far ($400 for shoes / $1400 for clothes and small accessories) but I feel super guilty about it. I love adding to my wardrobe but I've become extremely conscious about only buying items that I'm going to get lots of use out of. I no longer buy items just because they're on sale, they have to serve some purpose in my closet. I had to purchase a few more expensive items (ex: boots, coats, jeans) this year since they needed to be replaced but I still managed to score quite a few deals buying items secondhand so I spent less than expected. However, I can't seem to shake the guilt that I am still buying too much? I definitely think I could get by with less but shopping (or ""browsing"") has always been a hobby of mine so it's hard to shake. I did buy a few items this year that I probably didn't need since I'm continually adding to my closet.

My question is, how much have you spent this year? Is it more or less than expected? How do you shake the guilt that comes with spending money on your wardrobe when it could be better spent elsewhere?","How much have you spent on clothing, shoes, and accessories this year?"

Every few years I‚Äôd find my new perfect sneakers - black suede Skechers, Adidas Sambas, even Ecco sneakers. And by the time I hit my late 20s or so, I stopped wearing sneakers as part of non-workout outfit.  

I got some Allbirds - they are super comfy but read more casual than I like. I also has some New Balance in dusty pink that served the casual end of sneakers for me, and were very versatile. But I wore them out and retired them since I couldn‚Äôt find a good insole. (I purchased at least 7 that didn‚Äôt work).  

Lately, leather sneakers are back. And they are super in. 

I‚Äôve been saving all those Facebook ads, trying to find my perfect version to re-visit my 90s looks and wear them again. It‚Äôs come full circle - my casual tech job means I can wear sneakers if I want. And I have always loved sneakers with a dress. 

I had seen the Greats for a bit, and a couple of weeks ago they were on super sale at Nordstrom. I bought a bunch of pairs in a few colors, but the color and fit didn‚Äôt work for me.  Though I may have jumped on board with the right color. 

Yesterday, I was doing some window shopping and I came across the Koio store. The store was quiet so I had a lot of individual attention. I tried on a bunch of stuff.

Does how comfortable you feel wearing traditional garments have to do with your physical appearance and whether you‚Äôre viewed as ‚Äú[insert culture]‚Äù enough?

I reach for it all the time as it's a perfect jacket for fall and spring, easily layered with a rain coat if needed, and is the right warmth for inside in the winter because we keep our house cold at about 60F. It's also durable enough to stand up to my job - dog training and dog daycare. 

But my current jacket is white and light gray and is really showing its age and use. For its replacement, I'm trying to find something that fits the same niche, but maybe looks a bit more polished (but still totally reasonable for a dog trainer - it's weird if I wear business casual) and maybe doesn't have that microplastics issue.

Everything I've tried so far just isn't cutting it - I'll order a jacket online and it's way too lightweight or alternatively bulky or it doesn't look like it will hold up to some abuse, etc. For example, I'd totally go to sweaters, but they tend to not hold up well to dogs jumping up on you.

# Themes for this week are 1930s/1940s and Grayscale

## 1930s/1940s

Less of a common of a theme than the roaring 20s or swinging 50s, because of the Depression and WWII, but fashion still moved on! People gotta wear clothes. Go all out, or incorporate a piece or two that fits the styles of the era. Keep it tasteful. Annoy all the high-waist/wide pants haters on MFA by bringing your [widest pants](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e7/49/b7/e749b73a497bca9501eca5bab73f0751.jpg).

* Tyranny of Style [Costume Design for Alternative History: The Man in the High Castle](http://tyrannyofstyle.com/costume-design-man-in-the-high-castle) (alternative WWII timeline, interesting to see how they used 40s elements)

## Grayscale

Not the GoT disease, but monochrome with black/gray/white. 

If you're going true monochrome (i.e. all black or all white), try incorporating more texture and building a distinct silhouette. Adding accessories or layering items can make a look feel more like an Outfit and not a uniform.

368,femalefashionadvice,"Alright, some background (and sorry for the long post in advance)

I have lived in Florida my entire life (I am 22). The lowest temperatures I have seen are 17 degrees Fahrenheit, and that was when I was asleep so it does not really count. I think I have rarely been outside in weather below 50. I have seen snow \*once\* for a grand total of 30 minutes during a rest stop during a summit in Russia (which was a surprise to everyone considering it was early October!)

Well, a few years ago I made the awesome choice to learn Russian and have recently decided that I want to continue my post-undergrad education in Russia starting this February. I think you can already see where my dilemma is.

I will be living in Moscow and I have been trying to figure out how to dress for Moscow winters and I do not know where to begin and am stressing myself out. All I know is that there will be snow, there will be be below-freezing weather and that women in Moscow dress-up *a lot*. What's more is that the school I will be at for the semester has a very prestigious atmosphere and dress codes for each faculty (luckily, my only restriction for the language program is no shorts, no flip-flops which is not a problem for me). However, I know I need to dress a bit nicer than I would here for my university.

Essentially, I need help with everything winter clothing entails. (I know that is a lot, but I really am at a loss here). What hats do I get? Do I need earmuffs? Mittens vs gloves? Are jeans acceptable for the temperatures I will experience? WHAT SHOES DO I WEAR (I love heels and, due to my walking gait, can walk in them effortlessly, so keep that in mind maybe)? How do I layer clothes (lol)? I also workout, so how do I go about gym clothes? What kind of coats should I be looking at? And so on...

As far as budget is concerned, well, my family does not make a lot of money, so the cheaper the suggestion the better... but if it is an absolute must need, I may be able to make it work.

447,femalefashionadvice,"Hi everyone!! 

I recently bought a Uniqlo flannel shirt and I absolutely love the material. It feels reasonably stretchy, soft, not slippery like rayon blouses (for some reason I absolutely despise the texture of synthetic blouses), and it looks more put together compared to a cotton tee shirt.

The only problem is, the flannel is a bit too hot.  I have a disease that flares up whenever I get slightly overheated so it‚Äôs a hit of a problem. For example, sitting in a room with the heat on too high or walking with a backpack can cause a ton of heat to build up inside the flannel. It‚Äôs a pain because I also love wearing sweatshirts or sweaters over it too ): 

So I wanted to know ‚Äî are there button up shirts out there that are casual and soft like flannel, but not so warm? I also like the slightly androgynous vibe. 

I‚Äôve seen dress shirts mentioned in this sub but they aren‚Äôt as casual, loose/stretchy as a flannel shirt (even with jeans they make me look like I‚Äôm heading to an interview lol), and they are too structured to be casual (in my opinion). I love flannel because you can curl up into a ball or do jumping jacks in them without feeling super restrained‚Äî they‚Äôre like the winter version of T-shirts!

I'm planning on rebuilding my wardrobe from scratch after my wedding next month. As a 5' 150lbs women I have realized that nothing I buy will fit me right off the rack. So I am planning on shopping with tailoring as my end goal to get the fit right. My plan is to buy high quality basics to build off of.

I have large upper arms and would have to size up to get shirts to fit right in the arms‚Ä¶how much can I size up before it a shirt can‚Äôt be shortened/taken in anymore?

My jeans were ripped, one side of my coat was soaking, my stuff was everywhere, and my knee was swollen and bleeding.

At this moment in time I realised just how unpractical my clothing was. My trainers had zero grip, my jeans ripped straight away, my coat was not waterproof and was letting in the icy wind, and my shoulder bag definitely helped to propel me...

Less of a common of a theme than the roaring 20s or swinging 50s, because of the Depression and WWII, but fashion still moved on! People gotta wear clothes.

Not the GoT disease, but monochrome with black/gray/white. 

If you're going true monochrome (i.e. all black or all white), try incorporating more texture and building a distinct silhouette. Adding accessories or layering items can make a look feel more like an Outfit and not a uniform.

477,femalefashionadvice,"I stumbled upon this article [The ¬£7,500 dress that does not exist](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49794403) and found it fascinating. The idea is is that brands are starting to sell limited clothing collections that exist in the digital space - for the consumer to download and photoshop onto their body. They point out the likeness to buying custom skins for characters in video games like Fortnite, which I can see to certain extent. Anecdotally I remember spending money on custom wardrobes for my Stardoll account when I was 10-11 years old. However I think a key difference here is the blending of fiction/animation and reality. 

It makes me wonder if this is analogous to Facetuning your images. 

‚ÄúHe says the technology works for people who want the perfect image. ""If you don't like what you're wearing, but you love where you are, you now have the ability to transition your wardrobe, and digitally enhance the photograph to make it look like you're wearing the latest and greatest.‚Äù 

Will we be seeing a rise in ‚Äúfake‚Äù fashion influencers in the sense that there‚Äôll be people buying and downloading expensive designer clothing (but for cheap, or even free if it goes so far that you‚Äôll be able to pirate digital clothing) to create content with? Yet at the same time, if these ‚Äúfake‚Äù influencers style the clothing themselves, does it then become authentic because the idea is original? Like an upgraded version of the typical clothing collage on fashion blogs circa 2008. 

And fashion influencers aside, what does it mean for the average person?  Would digital clothing allow us to try trends we wouldn‚Äôt dare to try in real life? But why would one spend money on editing together a picture vs going to the store and trying it on in real life?

Over the past year or two, we have reached peak animal print - with all the cats, snakes, reptile, cows, and even zebras showing up in the prints.

With the trend exploding the way it has, brands are mixing it up on the execution - so some of the animal prints are a lot more deconstructed and graphic.  These are my favorite kinds of animal prints.  The extra large, greyscale, or watercolor versions of these traditionally loud prints. 

It is easy to find both a subtle, washed out version and a super graphic exaggerated version depending on your mood.

I need to purchase a supportive sneaker for when I can walk again after my foot surgery. Unfortunately I'm not allowed to wear my Converse.

86,femalefashionadvice,"I recently decided to try Sheertex pantyhose. I completely regret it. I was warned against posting a pantyhose review, but I wanted this to be out there for anyone who was thinking about using Sheertex. 

\*\*I posted this review on their website on Saturday, November 16, 2019, and I decided to check to see if it was still up this  morning, and **Sheertex had deleted my review.** I posted it again and took screenshots of its existence, which I will link below.\*\* 

Before I bought them, I tried to do some research, but I didn't find any reviews or comments on Reddit about this brand. The only postings I found online were from magazines that I thought probably had an interest in giving Sheertex a positive review, so I ignored those.

So, their website does not list a return policy. I tried googling it, but nothing came up besides their AU website, which does have a return/exchange policy outlined. I saw the website had a FAQ, [but it was completely blank.](https://imgur.com/XmFg8Q8) 

Last month was my birthday, and my husband was going to buy me a pair, so he messaged customer service to inquire about their return policy since it wasn't listed. He knows I've had issues with sizing guides before, and I also previously mentioned to him that I was particularly skeptical of Sheertex's sizing guide because it was only based on weight and not at all on height, unlike all the other pantyhose I've bought. (Note: I bought opaque pantyhose. The sizing guide for that only lists weight. Some of the other pantyhose list height and weight, but if you look at their recommendations, none of the sizing change in relation to height, only weight, so height is listed only arbitrarily.) 

He messaged customer service about how they handle returns/exchanges in cases where an item doesn't fit. He was advised there was a 30 day guarantee for exchange/return. **This was the answer they provided about sizing/satisfaction.** 

My husband decided to get me a different gift, but I decided to buy them a few weeks later. I bought a medium and a large; the sizing guide recommended large, which seemed wrong to me, so I decided I would get a medium and large to be safe. I was suspicious because I'm usually a small in most pantyhose, tights, leggings, etc. I weight 156, and [here is their sizing guide.](https://imgur.com/ldmPpVh)

# My experience with the product:

Neither pair fit, and I had other issues with them as well.

**The good:**

* The material is very sturdy.

**The bad:**

* Sizing guide is a disaster.
* The fit was terrible. They were both way too big. There was so much extra crotch fabric because I'm not very tall, and despite being 156 lbs, I'm rather fit looking. These pantyhose would need to be pulled up over my boobs to resolve the extra fabric in the crotch area. The extra/loose fabric was annoying and very uncomfortable.
* The waistband fabric was so thick that they did not look flush with my skin from the top of my clothes; the waistband was noticeably visible from my top layer of clothing, which was very disappointing. This would make more sense if they were too small and created a pinch or something, but both pairs were too big and they were not too tight at all, so this does not seem acceptable to me. I have never worn a pair of pantyhose, tights, leggings, etc. that had this big of a problem. The thickness of the waistband made them very uncomfortable to wear in the few minutes that I had them on when I tried them on. The waistband bunched up very easily, not unlike some other hosiery, but because it is so thick and uncomfortable, it was doubly uncomfortable and unattractive under clothing.
* The seam where the waistband meets the rest of the material/leg fabric has so much excess fabric/is so thick that the seam line sticks out even more than the rest of the thick waistband, which looks very noticeable and adds to how terrible these pantyhose look under clothing. I have never had pantyhose, tights, leggings, etc. that have a seam so thick that it is noticeably visible from my top layer of clothing; I‚Äôm used to this type of clothing looking smooth, flush, and totally unnoticeable under my clothing.¬†

So, I decided to contact customer service to see if I can return or exchange them. 

# My customer service experience:

I emailed customer service on Friday, November 8, 2019 at 3:17p CST, and I received an email back two days later on Sunday, November 10, 2019 at 9:29a CST saying that they do not accept any returns/exchanges. They asked what issues I had with the pantyhose. I emailed back that same day--Sunday, November 10, 2019-- just two hours later at 11:35a CST. I outlined all the information above, along with the information my husband had previously received about returns/exchanges. 

**I did not get a message back**, so on Wednesday, November 13, 2019 at 7:48a CST, I messaged them again to see if they were going to reply to me or if they were done assisting me.

I still had not received a message as of Saturday, November 16, 2019, so I decided to call their customer support line. It put me on hold for four minutes, saying that they will be with me shortly. After four minutes, it went to a message machine. I'm not sure why they didn't just say they were closed and to leave a message. I tried to leave a message and the line disconnected immediately. I thought this was possibly some connection error, so I called back. I wasted another four minutes on hold before it went to the message machine. I started talking, and it immediately disconnected again, so I couldn't even leave a message.¬†

After writing this post up, I decided to check to see if my review was still posted, and it has already been deleted, yet they still have not emailed me back from over a week ago.

116,femalefashionadvice,"to make a long story short i messed up my hair real bad. i bleached it myself and ruined it in june. went and got it dyed to fix it. the brown dye washes out.. left with yellow hair and a weird black ring where the shadow root was. i decide to do henna since my hair would probably fall out with box dye and red hair is better than yellow hair. left with a mess of about 10 different reds and oranges on my hair. genuinely look like a clown and now i cant dye over it again since its henna. every time i wash my hair it's hellllll. falls out like mad :(

i want to start wearing wigs while my damaged clown hair grows out. is this a good enough reason? i don't have much money, how long does a regular 20-60$ wig last? since I have blunt bangs already, do wigs with full bangs look more real?

122,femalefashionadvice,"For the last 2 years or so I've been on a ""Preppy Beatnik"" path. American prep looks with 60's mod, 50's bohemian, 90s grunge, 70s does 30s, and light sprinklings of punk. I was phasing out of a California cool/boho/twee mode and into much more minimalist and structured clothes. I got into crop kicks with clogs, folklore inspired prints and embroidery (still am into this!), classics with a twist, 80s revival of oversized tweed, high waists, dad jeans, etc. I also got into artsy minimalism, which I will write about in another post. I'm not sure it really suits me and I think I'm ready to move in another direction from that.

While I still love all my clothing and I won't do a huge overhaul of my wardrobe, ""Preppy Beatnik"" feels a little bit stale to me and not quite where I want to be and am feeling excited about.

I've been leaning towards prairie, Victorian, country, Western inspired, Americana, and 80s and 90s Victoriana looks, with a much more rough around the edges grunge style.

I'm into:

Sheer net or mesh long sleeved tees

Boilersuits and painter's pants

Patches and visible mending as decoration

Quilting or patchwork prints or literal patchwork

DIY, crafted, home-made, upcycled

Denim! So many washes, fits, and styles of jeans

Chunky ""Justin"" style boots that are worn in

Calico, cabbage rose florals, lush still-life florals, dark florals, tapestry

Layered looks like mesh long sleeved tees under a boxy oversized tee

Raw edges, holes, and threadbare things

Natural fabrics and textiles

I think I'm headed into a ""Prairie Punk"" direction. I love Western and Victorian touches done in unusual colors and styles. I really like a boiler suit with a bandana and a lace blouse underneath. I like the idea of a cotton poplin maxi skirt with ruffles with a band tee, a denim jacket, and dark lipstick.

[My Pinterest work in progress board](https://www.pinterest.com/naokel79/prairie-punk/)

What makes this different than punk is:

--not a lot of black, white, and red 

--not a lot of skin showing or focus on tightly fitted club wear 

--no patent leather or shiny vinyl/rubber 

--softer, more feminine touches, this is not a hard, edgy, dramatic, and feral look

--less focus on bands, music, and culture, more on historical looks

What makes this not just straight 70s prairie revival:

--combination of architectural silhouettes with 70s prairie looks (spinnaker dresses, kimono shaped jackets, a-line trapeze tops)

--functional, tomboy-lite elements like band tees, vintage men's sweatshirts, Docs, overalls, boilersuits

--updated hair and makeup (unnatural colored hair, experimental makeup)

--less fussy silhouettes and lines, less literal vintage nostalgia interpretation

Challenges:

Keeping it flattering

Keeping it polished and intentional enough for work and other events

Not looking overdone or try hard

Anyway, enough about me! What's your style direction for 2020? Is it different than 2019? What elements are you loving and want more of for 2020? What will you retire and move on from?

# Rules

* Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but [keep it constructive/factual, and try to focus on feedback that will help the person improve based on their goals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3jfxk8/how_to_give_and_receive_constructive_criticism_a/)
* Link directly to images on Imgur or anywhere else you care to host them as long as the URL ends in .jpg or .png. Please don't link to Instagram posts or blog posts for your photos. You're welcome to include a link to your IG in your post, but people should not need to go to your blog/feed to see your outfits. See [Rules on Blogger Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/rules) for the full description of FFA's rules.
* Don't downvote for disagreeing with someone's opinion.

You should have at least one clear photo showing your whole outfit in a neutral pose (if you want to share more in fun poses or share detail pics that's fine too, but we should be able to see the whole outfit).

It's always helpful to other users if you provide some context on what you wore the outfit for and what your goals were. If you want to write more about your outfit creation process or what inspired you, that's great! But 1-2 sentences is fine too. For example, ""It's raining here and I wore this to run errands. I was inspired by the color scheme and attitude of [this bird](https://i.imgur.com/bSSMVYh.gifv)""

# Themes for this week are Punk and Play With Volume

## Punk

I am just going to steal u/thomaspaine's description that he wrote for the **MFA [Hardcore / Punk / Skinhead](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/181nzj/hardcore_punk_skinhead_inspiration_album/) inspiration album**:

&gt; The [British subcultures](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/wip7c/british_subcultures_and_fashions_primer_19501980/) section of the sidebar covers skinheads pretty well, so I won't really go into that.
&gt; 
&gt; [Punk fashion](http://i.imgur.com/dxEggMa.jpg) reflected the genre's anti-establishment, anti-materialistic themes. Ripped clothing, safety pins, studded leather, BDSM wear, elaborate hairstyles, and androgynous outfits were popular styles that were meant to shock and offend the mainstream. Although most people think of punk fashion as being something which arose organically out of the gutter classes, designers such as Vivienne Westwood and Malcom McLaren were very important in shaping punk style.
&gt;
&gt; The late 70s and early 80s saw a lot of divergence in punk rock, an important one being the rise of American Hardcore. Hardcore punk was a faster, more aggressive, distilled version of punk rock, and the styles worn by bands and fans reflected this. In reaction to the elaborate fashions of punk rockers, hardcore fans adopted a dressed down everyday man style, which usually consisted of simple jeans, t-shirts, and athletic wear; essentially an [anti-fashion uniform](http://i.imgur.com/7aEjxWG.jpg). To quote Keith Morris:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;""the punk scene was basically based on English fashion. But we had nothing to do with that. Black Flag and the Circle Jerks were so far from that. We looked like the kid who worked at the gas station or submarine shop.""
&gt;
&gt; The early hardcore scene was influenced by punk and the 80s skinhead revival, so it's not uncommon to see bands wearing some mix of these styles. [Early American skinheads](http://i.imgur.com/zWkxiEx.jpg) for instance kept the shaved heads of [British skinheads](http://i.imgur.com/1JRU8j8.jpg), but tended to forgo the Ben Sherman shirts, braces, and Doc Marten boots.
&gt; 
&gt; Metal began having a much larger influence on hardcore in the late 80s and early 90s, and you start to see the adoption of much more black, camo, and ostentatious graphic tees.

I was unable to find a more """"""standard"""""" punk (i.e. would not be roasted as ""that's just &lt;other style&gt; but with docs"") from FFA but if anyone knows of one, please share. 

## Play with volume

If you usually do fitted on top and loose on bottom, try the other way around! Or vice versa. Or try loose-loose! Or show off an outfit featuring an item with an interesting silhouette.

154,femalefashionadvice,"Hi all! I am new to the sub, hopefully this is an okay topic for a standalone post.

I've seen a couple threads on dressing to accommodate various physical challenges. However, I haven't seen many people talk about accessories. I'm looking to up my game with jewelry and scarves (or other accessories), but find the sensation of loose or dangling things around my wrists/neck unbearable. Plus with ADHD I struggle with having the patience to make thoughtful choices instead of just running out the door as soon as my clothes are on (not to mention losing anything that's not securely attached lol). As a result my outfits are almost all just clothes, shoes, and my do-everything-backpack. It's... *fine...* but boring as hell! I often read about elevating an outfit by adding accessories, or talking about them as a way to add variety to a wardrobe without having to buy new clothes. In theory it sounds great but I have no idea how to implement it in my life.

Since skinnies replaced low-cut flares (and since, i suppose, i'm not a teenage-shape anymore), jeans have been awful.

I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts on here about women wanting to ‚Äúavert the male gaze‚Äù through their fashion choices.  At the same time, women will often want advice on how to dress for a date.

Is trying to avert the male gaze a feminist act, or a non feminist act because we shouldn‚Äôt care?  

What about using fashion as a way to manipulate men?  My job is 95% men and I‚Äôve noticed if I put on a nice 1950s housewife dress, not low cut, and red lipstick I have a better chance of getting a client to sign vs a male coworker or if I show up in jeans and a t shirt (my industry is typically casual).  I also wear certain items of clothing my husband likes me in sometimes as a thank you for how good he is to me.  My sister uses evening wear to manipulate men into taking her on expensive dates and buy her things.

On the flip side if I am going to be in a situation where I don‚Äôt want to be hit on or stared at I will wear something unflattering.

Does this subtle manipulation make me anti feminist? 

Are any of your fashion choices made with the male gaze in mind, to avert or attract?  Or do you just not care?

And is the ultimate feminist the one who just doesn‚Äôt care at all about the male gaze in any situation?

I‚Äôve been seeing this whole ‚Äúmale gaze‚Äù thing floating around this sub for a while and I think it‚Äôs something important to discuss.  I‚Äôm curious as to what all of you do.",The male gaze and its role in female fashion and feminism - want your opinions

Explanations of the change are varied: some see it as a rejection of rising prices for luxury RtW, or fashion fatigue exacerbated by the frenetic pace of the streetwear trends that have been a major influence in recent years. Others see it as a retrenchment to safe ground in a climate of sociopolitical uncertainty.

Or, perhaps, this anti-trend is simply a trend itself. Per the quote at the end of the article:

# Themes for this week are Punk and Play With Volume

## Punk

I am just going to steal u/thomaspaine's description that he wrote for the **MFA [Hardcore / Punk / Skinhead](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/181nzj/hardcore_punk_skinhead_inspiration_album/) inspiration album**:

&gt; The [British subcultures](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/wip7c/british_subcultures_and_fashions_primer_19501980/) section of the sidebar covers skinheads pretty well, so I won't really go into that.
&gt; 
&gt; [Punk fashion](http://i.imgur.com/dxEggMa.jpg) reflected the genre's anti-establishment, anti-materialistic themes. Ripped clothing, safety pins, studded leather, BDSM wear, elaborate hairstyles, and androgynous outfits were popular styles that were meant to shock and offend the mainstream. Although most people think of punk fashion as being something which arose organically out of the gutter classes, designers such as Vivienne Westwood and Malcom McLaren were very important in shaping punk style.
&gt;
&gt; The late 70s and early 80s saw a lot of divergence in punk rock, an important one being the rise of American Hardcore. Hardcore punk was a faster, more aggressive, distilled version of punk rock, and the styles worn by bands and fans reflected this. In reaction to the elaborate fashions of punk rockers, hardcore fans adopted a dressed down everyday man style, which usually consisted of simple jeans, t-shirts, and athletic wear; essentially an [anti-fashion uniform](http://i.imgur.com/7aEjxWG.jpg). To quote Keith Morris:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;""the punk scene was basically based on English fashion. But we had nothing to do with that. Black Flag and the Circle Jerks were so far from that. We looked like the kid who worked at the gas station or submarine shop.""
&gt;
&gt; The early hardcore scene was influenced by punk and the 80s skinhead revival, so it's not uncommon to see bands wearing some mix of these styles. [Early American skinheads](http://i.imgur.com/zWkxiEx.jpg) for instance kept the shaved heads of [British skinheads](http://i.imgur.com/1JRU8j8.jpg), but tended to forgo the Ben Sherman shirts, braces, and Doc Marten boots.
&gt; 
&gt; Metal began having a much larger influence on hardcore in the late 80s and early 90s, and you start to see the adoption of much more black, camo, and ostentatious graphic tees.

I was unable to find a more """"""standard"""""" punk (i.e. would not be roasted as ""that's just &lt;other style&gt; but with docs"") from FFA but if anyone knows of one, please share. 

## Play with volume

If you usually do fitted on top and loose on bottom, try the other way around! Or vice versa. Or try loose-loose! Or show off an outfit featuring an item with an interesting silhouette. Try new things; have fun.

For my part‚ÄîI‚Äôm in the process of letting my grey hair grow in; I‚Äôm in my 40s but greyed very early, and now have hair that‚Äôs about 50% silver and 50% very dark ash brown, whereas for years I was dying it a warm medium auburn. I‚Äôm finding that I‚Äôm going for a more dramatic approach to my makeup as a result‚Äîlighter foundation, darker brows, a redder lip. Clothing-wise the change is inspiring me to go back to my goth roots and stick more strictly to a black- and grey- only palette (although I do let army green and white/ivory sneak in here and there). However, I‚Äôve had to stop wearing light and medium grey shirts because they now match my hair (which I usually wear down) and look blah for that reason.

258,femalefashionadvice,"Hi there, I just wanted to share a little [wardrobe cataloguing project](https://someusesomewear.wordpress.com) I‚Äôve been working on over the last couple of months. 

To back up, I‚Äôve always loved exploring personal style, but in the past few years I‚Äôve been trying to balance my desire to shop with my conflicting desire to have less things in my wardrobe. This is nothing new. Businesses have been built on this battle we fight behind our closet doors. 

I‚Äôve done the spreadsheets ‚Äì I even drew illustrations of all the items in my closets at one point. And each time, hours later, after I lovingly folded and put everything back, I would be washed over with this feeling of satisfaction. Mostly gratitude for all the wonderful things I have, but with a touch of guilt, knowing that I have much more than I realistically need and can use up. Yet, within days that feeling would disappear, and within months, a few thrifting trips later, I‚Äôd start to lose track of my closet situation again. 

So after some thinking, I came up with the idea to make a ‚Äú[slow catalogue](https://someusesomewear.wordpress.com/wardrobe/)‚Äù, one that would force me to pay more attention to the individual pieces of clothing I have. Each entry in this catalogue would have images of an item, including close-ups of the details, along with a little write-up. It would be an exercise in analyzing the pieces I have, examining the quality, the use and the wear. It‚Äôs also about surfacing some of the stories I have related to these pieces, thinking about the relationships I have with my clothes, contemplating my feelings about style and consumerism in general, plus anything else that comes to mind.

My intention was to not buy anything during this experiment, or do so very selectively. I‚Äôm hoping the process of creating my visual wardrobe in this slow, convoluted way, would make the awareness and ‚Äúhigh‚Äù of doing a major wardrobe clean-out last over a longer period of time. This format also acknowledges that a wardrobe is a work in progress and will hopefully urge me to make better choices about what I choose to bring in. It‚Äôs like a self-guided wardrobe therapy exercise.

So far I‚Äôm about 1/7 through. I‚Äôve been doing it through a blog platform, but really it‚Äôs been a journal for myself.

At this point, I‚Äôd love to get some feedback. Is this something people in this sub would be interested in reading? Is this something that others would like to do with me ‚Äì maybe not for your entire wardrobe, but as little writing exercises? Could we put together something like this [book](http://wornstories.com/)?

259,femalefashionadvice,"Hello, I‚Äôll be traveling to Chicago and the Midwest area  this Thanksgiving and I have no idea how to prepare for the cold.

300,femalefashionadvice,"[The infiltration of casual attire into the workplace is nothing new; t-shirts and jeans have been the uniform of Silicon Valley startups and their ilk for decades now, as *The Atlantic* notes in their 2017 essay on the decline of business casual](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/05/history-of-business-casual/526014/). 

Now, as 2019 draws to a close, it seems that even business casual may fade into the background as the last bastions of formality, the traditionally stodgy industries of finance and law, continue to abandon the professional attire that has been their uniform for decades in favour of ""anything goes, so long as it's appropriate"" codes, [a phenomenon the *Wall Street Journal* reported on last week](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-much-fashion-is-too-much-fashion-at-work-11573155040).

&gt; Like many women, Ms. Mu is gauging how much of her passion for fashion to bring to work. In the age of Instagram, panache can translate into ego-boosting likes from friends or, in the case of influencers, lucrative endorsement deals.

* How has casual dress moving into the workplace influenced your style?
* Do you no longer maintain separate ""work"" and ""weekend"" wardrobes? Have more crossover between the two?

304,femalefashionadvice,"Hello. I hope this is the right place to ask this question as I've searched all over the internet and can't find the answer.

As winter is approaching, I have pulled out all of my wool coats and garments. I recently got a ""dry clean only"" wool jacket dry cleaned, and when I picked it up from the cleaners, it seemed that it has shrunken. It wasn't damaged or anything and no fabric melted, but it was obviously smaller than when I gave it to the cleaners. In order to achieve the oversized fit again, I began stretching the coat by hand. This was probably a bad idea but I wasn't comfortable with putting it in water or using an unshrinking product. So I began stretching each area by hand and I would hear this ripping noise every time I pull. At first I thought it was just the sound of clung together fibres stretching but I am thinking now that it could be the fabric literally ripping (micro-tears since it's not a visible rip to the eye)? I don't know how to proceed at this point and I was wondering if anyone could help... Will the wool become stretched over more wear? Is the ripping noise a big deal? because I did this to every little area of the jacket.

I am upset that the garment's instruction is to ""dry clean only"" but dry cleaning shrunk it. Was I supposed to say anything on my part when I gave it to the cleaners? For future reference, so that I don't ruin another $500 jacket. Ugh.

319,femalefashionadvice,"Hey guys,

I am a 25 year old who has always felt uncomfortable wearing clothes to look ‚Äúnice.‚Äù I dress extremely casually unless I have to. My go-tos are athletic clothes and jeans w sweaters. However, this doesn‚Äôt fly in a bizcaz office job, and I‚Äôm trying to dress ‚Äúnicely‚Äù without feeling uncomfortable. I really like the athletic aesthetic and I‚Äôm not sure how to carry that over into office-appropriate clothing.

I like the silhouette of tapered trousers and boxy tops. I also (as obnoxious as this sounds) spend a lot of my time on fitness and I like my clothes to signify this, which is difficult with work wear. Comfort is definitely a factor; I have to be able to move in my clothes. Shoes other than my Stan Smiths make me feel like I‚Äôm playing dress-up. i cannot do skirts/dresses/florals and I also despise trousers that aren‚Äôt fitted. I consider myself pretty feminine (in terms of hair and makeup, etc) and I don‚Äôt want my clothes to be masculine, but I don‚Äôt like my clothes to be ultra-girly - this makes me a bit uncomfortable bc most formal clothes are quite gendered.

Anyway if anyone can help me I‚Äôd really appreciate it! If not guess I continue to wear my blouses and cardigans and flats and hate every second of it lol",Please help me feel good in office wear

As time went on and I got older, I still had the will to dress myself in a nostalgic and whimsical way, but the very youth-oriented and frankly impractical street styles don't really appeal to me anymore. I've seen quite a few folks on here post albums which I feel are trying to connect with a similar spirit, but ""strega"" and ""mori"" don't really quite hit it and I'm always having a hard time finding the kind of styles I'm looking for!

1. Whimsical
2. Practical 
3. Nostalgic
4. Natural
5. Vernacular

The second order was for plain t-shirts for my husband, made in the same factory as James Perse. These were priced really well ($12 each) but didn't seem like anything special to me or my husband. I did buy one for my brother, who owns a lot of actual James Perse, and I will ask him for his comparison. My third order was for a cashmere turtleneck, which arrived today. I LOVE it.

433,femalefashionadvice,"I keep seeing ads for [JW PEI](https://www.jwpei.com/) bags on Instagram and was wondering how their quality was. According to [their About page](https://www.jwpei.com/pages/our-story-jw-pei), all of their linings are made with 100% recycled plastic and are certified by Global Recycling Standards, yet all of their prices are under $100. That page also had a few spelling errors (e.g. ""no body"" and ""planing"") and in general seemed too good to be true, so I tried to look more into the brand.

According to [their media page](https://www.jwpei.com/pages/press), they were featured in an Independent article called 9 Best Vegan Bags, but when I found [that article](https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/best-vegan-handbags-world-vegan-month-stella-mccartney-a6738941.html), they didn't mention JW Pei at all, which seemed pretty sketchy. However, I did find [a Vogue article](https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/best-eco-bags) that says:

&gt;Committed to designing with only the finest vegan leather, JW PEI‚Äôs motto, ‚ÄòBuy Beautiful Handbags. Save Animal Lives‚Äô is at the core of the business and 10% of its profits are donated to animal sanctuaries around the world. The brand is also dedicated to helping to provide better food, living conditions and shelters for its workers, with every purchase further aiding the cause.

That sounds pretty legitimate, and the Vogue's article's link to the JW PEI website was not an affiliate link.

Their website doesn't have reviews, but I did watch [this video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPz7SgE1JM), which says that the bag she ordered was smaller than expected, had ""cheap-looking"" gold hardware, and smelled plasticky. It also shipped from China, which might explain the spelling errors in the About page but does raise some questions about the ethics of the brand.

One of the YouTube comments under that video said:

&gt;Yeah, I got that bag but in black. I had similar thoughts - I thought it was going to be larger and the colour of the hardware threw me off aswell. However I have used the bag for several months now and I am quite pleased. The stitching is really high quality, the material doesn't scuff. And I think the material of mine is different. It's this matte faux leather and it doesn't smell.   
They do a good job at marketing it as a really really high quality bag. It's a good bag, not cheap or a scam but not high end either.

These seem to be pretty mixed results, so I was wondering whether anyone knows anything about its brand, its values, and its products.",Opinions on JW Pei?

WAYWT (""What are you wearing today""), but with themes! It's co-ed and hosted by FFA. Share some inspiration photos, float your outfit ideas, and discuss this week's themes here! The goal is to have some fun creating outfits in a slightly more focused way, not to win a contest on Who Can Be The Most Theme.


# Themes for this week are Androgynous and Hats/Hair Accessories

## Androgynous

Or if you don't want to go the full androgynous outfit route, try and incorporate an element of womenswear or menswear which you don't usually go for into your outfit.

## Hats/Hair Accessories

Put together an outfit featuring a hat or hair accessory! Stay cozy in a beanie or beret, bring out your wide-brimmed hats, bucket hat, or wear that long-neglected baseball cap. Or if hats aren't your thing, feature a hair accessory like a headband, barrettes, or scrunchie.

It feels great seeing a person of color like myself look so divine in a world where you have places like Brandy Melville whose walls are plastered with pictures of exclusively thin and young white girls. 

Being reminded of how much representation matters, even in the smallest places, inspires me to make sure that I represent our diverse populace in the inspiration albums I make.

I feel like wearing a purse around indoors for hours on end seems a bit odd, and may make it seem like I'm dressed for leisure and not work or like I'm itching to be done and leave. It's a particularly weird situation when I'm with a big group but the only one carrying something because my clients have stashed their own stuff at their desk. Obviously if we start in a conference room and I can leave my stuff there, it's ideal, but that's usually not the case.

44,femalefashionadvice,"My lurking streak has been broken because I just absolutely have to rant about this.

Before this summer, I have never worn high-waisted ANYTHING. Didn't hate it, just never tried it. I'm moderately tall for a girl, so people always tell me high-wasited stuff would look good on me ""because you've got such loooong legs!"" I finally cracked and bought a pair of high-waisted shorts this summer, and I loved how they looked. Wore that shit at every opportunity. 

My friends and I were planning on going to a club for the weekend. I figure, ""hey, this is a great time to invest in my first pair of high-waisted jeans!"" so I go out shopping, grab some from a store, and go to try them on. 

Nope. NOPE. NOOOOPE. That shit does NOT work for me. It makes my torso look like a squash. No matter what the fit was, the fabric would bunch up at the point where my thighs and my hips connect. I flew outta that changing room in a rage, realizing that I had been lied to my whole life! High waisted jeans look TERRIBLE on me. 

So... how the heck do you people pull these things off? I see them in pictures and on other people and they look just fine, but on me they look like ill-fitting tight-cut pajamas. 

And on that note, have you guys ever encountered clothing that everyone insisted was ""for you"" but turned out to be a disaster?",High-waisted jeans...how the heck do you wear them!?

59,femalefashionadvice,"Hello!

I'm hoping this is the right place to get some help with sizing in women's clothing. Since I don't wear it, it's hard for me to understand how all the sizing works out.

I'm trying to buy a baselayer (just the top) for a friend for the winter, but somewhat confused on the size I should buy for them.

Though because we're just friends, I don't know her specific sizes. Here is what I do know:

-She is about 5'4""

-she weights 135-140lbs

-she has a reasonably large bust as well. (At least a C, maybe a D cup size -- again I can't know her size for sure)

I have two options to choose from a women's base layer or a men's base layer. The men's one would probably look better for what she needs it for, but I'm worried the sizing might not work well for her. Since men don't need extra room in the chest and since she if fairly large in that area I'm worried the men's sizes wouldn't fit her body properly. I'm also worried that the collar may be pulled down if she had the men's size. Because this is a base layer that needs to go under her other clothing it needs to fit her well, be tight against her body, but not too tight. My first question is do men's sizes work women if you need a close fitting top?

My second question pertains to the women's sizes. Are there any ladies out there that might be able to guess her size (specifically her bust size since every online sizing chart accounts for this) based on the details I've given above?

For example, I've been narrowing down what fits I like and what flatters me for the past year or so, and now that I've got a solid idea of what I like, I'm ready to implement!

But currently, I don't actually **need** too much new clothing.  I'm trying to be more aware of how I consume and so I obviously don't want to just get rid of clothes or buy a whole all at once, also for monetary and space reasons. I'll usually donate things if I haven't worn them in over a year or if they don't fit, and slowly replace items that way. However, whenever things I actually like and will wear are in style, I'm tempted to ""stock up"" on certain colors and cuts, but feel bad about buying too much.

I love the freedom from my dear friend who is such a lovely low maintenance bride, but it makes it so hard to find a dress! She doesn't care about cut or length so long as it is reasonably modest--no deep Vs past the ribcage, backless, or like sheer fabrics-- but can still be trendy or even figure-hugging. 

This has given me a lot of options, and yet, the vintage dress I fell in love with obviously doesn't come in the wide range she has given me. I don't plan to test her by picking a dress outside of the color range, but i was thinking of having it professionally dyed. Normally, I would just pick another dress.... but also, she is the last of my friends and sisters to get married (so ill never be a bridesmaid or possibly even guest again... or at least for a while), and weddings are the only formal events I ever attend.  I would literally probably never have the opportunity to wear it at another time, and for whatever reason, it has a piece of my heart and I'd love to get to wear it. 

Have any of you had any garments professionally dyed? I've dyed fabrics on my own, but those were usually unimportant things like white dresses and blouses that had become to dingy, but were still lovely and wearable. Would love any advice from you all.

\- The dress is mostly silk crepe, with a bit of velvet on the bust trim. It is lightly lined, but is otherwise not a fabric heavy or  layered dresses

\-  It is one of those sorts of minimal, slip dresses that Calvin Klein made famous in the early 90s. The dress is about 25-30 years old. 

\- It is in excellent condition (the previous owner took incredible care of the dress including keeping it in a preservation bag).

# Rules

* Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but [keep it constructive/factual, and try to focus on feedback that will help the person improve based on their goals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3jfxk8/how_to_give_and_receive_constructive_criticism_a/)
* Link directly to images on Imgur or anywhere else you care to host them as long as the URL ends in .jpg or .png. Please don't link to Instagram posts or blog posts for your photos. You're welcome to include a link to your IG in your post, but people should not need to go to your blog/feed to see your outfits. See [Rules on Blogger Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/rules) for the full description of FFA's rules.
* Don't downvote for disagreeing with someone's opinion.

You should have at least one clear photo showing your whole outfit in a neutral pose (if you want to share more in fun poses or share detail pics that's fine too, but we should be able to see the whole outfit).

It's always helpful to other users if you provide some context on what you wore the outfit for and what your goals were. If you want to write more about your outfit creation process or what inspired you, that's great! But 1-2 sentences is fine too. For example, ""It's raining here and I wore this to run errands.

# FAQ

* **Can I suggest a theme or changes to the schedule?** Of course! Please suggest themes in the Tuesday discussion threads and include the full description that will be posted for it. It's great to include some examples, links to inspiration, and things to consider. If you would like to suggest changes to the schedule, you can discuss that there too.
* **Do I have to do both themes?** You can do either theme or both themes!
* **Can I submit more than one outfit for a theme?** Yes! If you really dig a theme or just want to share different iterations of an outfit, feel free to share all your photos.

* **Will themes ever repeat?** If you are keen on repeating a theme please suggest that in the Tuesday announcement/discussion thread. If a lot of people also want to try a theme again I'm down to repeat some.

181,femalefashionadvice,"I need to talk about this to you all, because I have a lot of feelings and very few venues to express them. 

I love fashion, and I also love running. The intersection of these two loves exists in Alexi Pappas, Olympic long distance runner and undiscovered fashion icon.

Her style feels like what would happen if a 5 year old girl was given $1000 to purchase an entirely new wardrobe, but said 5 year old was also sponsored by Champion apparel. It's like a rococo painting put on a pair of Hoka ones and decided to run a 10K through Mammoth Lakes. It's one part performance wear, one part fairy princess, one part dad's workout attire from the 80s, and one part grandma's loungewear. 

I'm well aware her style is not going to be for everyone. In fact, her style is so far removed from what any sane person would wear on a regular basis that it's entirely unique and her own. That's one of the things I love so much about it. She smashes two completely conflicting styles in the most dissonant way possible and does it with an unabashed, genuine, goofy grin on her face. It's inspiring. I want to be her best friend. If she wasn't married, I'd seriously consider proposing to her. 

We talk a lot about dressing for yourself in what makes you feel comfortable on this sub, and Alexi feels like the epitome of this idea. There's absolutely no consideration for social conventions, trends, or propriety in her style. It's completely, 100% her. I know that this isn't something that a lot of us can achieve, because we have to work in places with strict dress codes. I totally respect that and fall into that category myself. However, I think it's really heartwarming to see someone enjoying fashion in the way that she does. She seems to have a lot of fun with it and doesn't seem too concerned with looking cool in the process.

Please enjoy some of my favorite looks of hers, all taken from her instagram (@alexipappas):

279,femalefashionadvice,"So, I finished Season 2 of Succession recently, and the fashion and style community has been going gaga over Shiv's clothes for a while already. It's time for me to post a few of my favorite images of her, since I've been obsessively copying her style recently. Because of her, I have in the past two months bought a silk shirt and a nice scarf. It's not practical for me to get a suit set yet, but I am tempted. 

I think what makes her outfits stand out is the cut, the colors, and the fit. The clothes are tailored so well to her body frame. (She's become famous for her booty on the other subs)

This [shirt](https://imgur.com/LhpVeZm) looks like any other silk shirt we find on the market, but I don't think it's easy to find a color that wonderful, it's like a deep burgundy color.

This [white blouse](https://imgur.com/vWD6N1K) \- which totally wowed me when I saw it, is just exquisite.  

I also liked the subtle changes between Season 1 and Season 2 of the series. She wore [softer tones](https://imgur.com/RY24N8G) in the first, and more [boss lady fits](https://imgur.com/EiW3J2r) in the second. I think her clothes in second season are more stunning. My favorite outfit of hers is the blazer dress, no competition. 

Her style is also pretty practical and not that hard to copy - which makes me happy buying clothes that actually can be part of my daily wardrobe.

282,femalefashionadvice,"I needed a new pair of leggings today as it's mostly all I wear when the weather gets colder.

I am ridiculously apple shaped and have a surgical scar on my stomach that makes it an odd shape so you can imagine that this is a very big problem for me.  I can't wear mid rise at all.  

I went home empty handed with no leggings.

This wasn't a problem this time last year.

Have high waist bands suddenly disappeared?

I found one high waisted pair in H&amp;M but they were bunching around the hips and knees and were about 3 inches too long (I am 5'3).",Are high waisted styles disappearing?
283,femalefashionadvice,"I want to begin by saying I have done a lot of research and read previous posts in this subreddit but I still feel like I am at a loss. I'm starting to feel really upset and frustrated by my height.

I have tried petite sections, but there are a few issues. The first being that it's very frustrating that petites are considered ""5'3 and under."" My best friend is 5'3 and can fit into normal pants for the most part fine. I'm 5'1 and even petite pants are usually too long on me. I feel that's such a broad range. Just as an example 5'3 is very different from 4'9. 

Second, I just recently turned 21. I feel like most retailers who have a petite section just fill it with business styles or styles for middle aged - senior women. I don't know where to turn to for younger looking styles. 

 Lastly, I happen to have longer legs and a short torso, as opposed to short legs and a longer torso. This results in a lot of petite clothing being a really awkward fit. Also, I have a big bust. I am about a size 14 as I have recently gained weight. I could barely find pants when I was short and a size 2, much less now. I feel like petite sections try to fit one standard size and it just doesn't work.

Online doesn't work for me. Due to my weird proportions most online items end up returned. I live in a tiny rural town with not many stores so it's difficult to return in-store. A lot of younger petite clothing I've seen are from other countries and return shipping can get expensive.

It took me a couple of years to build the wardrobe I had, but a flood destroyed my home so now I'm back to 0. I don't know where to begin. I know tailoring is another option but I gained weight due to health reasons and I'm trying to desperately lose it and get back to my normal size. My weight fluctuates often and I don't want to spend money getting items tailored I might get rid of in the immediate future. And if I'm being honest, there are some things like leggings I just want to walk into a store and buy, not have to get tailored.

I am feeling especially frustrated due to other elements in my life, and I just feel like this is the one thing that should be easy. No matter my research and reading, I'm not making progress and everything seems tailored to other body types and I'm just feeling tired. I just want to find clothing I like, that's easy, fits with my style and age, and feel like myself again.

Sorry this is so long, thank you guys for any help and advice!

Tldr; I feel petite styles don't encompass a lot of actual petite body types, the styles are for older women, and I don't even know where to begin buying. Try to lose weight so getting things tailored seems fruitless, but I have to rebuild my whole wardrobe due to a flood so this has me especially frustrated right now. I desperately need some help. :/",As a petite / short young woman I feel incredibly frustrated. I don't feel like there are many resources or help for us.

# Themes for this week are Prep and Art-inspired

## Prep

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preppy) article on prep style:

&gt; Examples of preppy attire include argyle sweaters, crewneck sweaters, grosgrain or woven leather belts, chinos, madras, Nantucket Reds, button down Oxford cloth shirts, pearl necklaces and earrings, gold bangle or large chain bracelets, penny loafers, polo shirts (often with a popped collar), and boat shoes.

## Art-inspired

Put together an outfit inspired by a piece of art. Take inspiration from the shapes, colors, and textures of any piece that catches your eye. [@peoplewholooklikeart](https://www.instagram.com/peoplewholooklikeart/) on Instagram has a lot of fun examples for this. Please include an image of your inspiration if you do this one.

308,femalefashionadvice,"Earlier today I went to my local mall on a search for jeans. I had gone a couple of weeks ago and tried on jeans at the typical stores (madewell, jcrew, lucky brand, gap) but couldn‚Äôt find anything that would fit. Nothing would comfortably fit my butt and thighs and also my waist. I also have a long torso so high waisted really needs to be high. 

On to today. I decided to embrace my old lady side and venture into Talbots. My grandma had bought me sweaters there before, and they are some of my favorites, so I figured I‚Äôd try it out. For context, I am 25 years old. When I walked in I was definitely the youngest one there. I grabbed some pairs of jeans, a soft sweater, and a sweater dress. I tried on the jeans and they fit... perfectly. They hugged my thighs but didn‚Äôt squeeze. They snuggly fit my waist, above the hip. The calves were fitted but not tight. I haven‚Äôt worn them out yet but so far I‚Äôm impressed. The sweaters were also nice and soft and didn‚Äôt feel tight on my athletic arms/shoulders. 

Over all, great experience. If you have preppy casual style, you can definitely find some great clothes there. Some items were definitely older looking, but the basics were actually basic without trendy fits.  It reminded me of how jcrew used to be.  Hopefully the quality holds up so I can wear these pieces for a while!",A reluctantly positive review of Talbots

318,femalefashionadvice,"I am so frustrated by Rolla's denim sizing. I'm a 27 or 28 in Levi's, Madewell, Free People, and essentially every other brand.  I saw that Rolla's Dusters have no stretch so I went with a 28.  Couldn't get them past my mid thigh.  So I sent them back and got a 29.  Couldn't get them over my butt.  The issue is, the actual room in the waist and butt looks about right.  It appears to be that the thigh area of the jean is smaller than what I'm used to.  I sent the 29s back and exchanged for a different wash (since some brands sizing varies between washes). No, same issue. I feel like even a 30 would be too small in the leg.

But how? I‚Äôm interested in trying to take more inspiration from designer looks directly. 

How do you use high fashion as inspiration for more attainable wear? Is it basically just trying to emulate certain trends with cheaper versions of the clothing found thrifted or at other stores?

336,femalefashionadvice,"I see Nooworks recommended here a lot. This sub lead me to discover the brand myself. I was really drawn to Nooworks due to the prints they offer and the fact that it's focus on being a women-owned business.  Because I see the brand recommended so frequently here I thought I'd share my experience since I have yet to see any ""real life"" photos or reviews. I hope this can help anyone who may be considering the brand. 

**Sizing:**

First off it is really cumbersome to try and figure out your size on Nooworks because not every item has a size chart and the size really varies across items. Sizing info is also found on various spots on the web so it's really confusing. For example:

Sizing info on their [FAQ'](https://www.nooworks.com/pages/faqs)s page vs an individual item's sizing info

For individual items, the sizing chart and what info is available is further complicated by the fact that some items have reference images for sizing [like this piece](https://www.nooworks.com/collections/jumpsuits/products/coverallsgreenflash-1) while [others don't.](https://www.nooworks.com/collections/dresses/products/mollymagic-1#)

*My personal experience:* I've ordered 5 items from Nooworks and the fit has been all over the place.  Clothes were generally very big every where except for the waist. Lengths are also excessively long. This happened across the board for me despite following the sizing chart to the best of my abilities.

I ordered 1 jumpsuit and a coverall and the fit was sooo bad that I had no choice but to return them - which really sucked due to their terrible return fees on top of a $100+ purchase. The fit was not flattering at all - it was huger in my butt and chest but tight across my waist. There was no way I was going to spend $$ getting it altered. 

**Pricing/Ordering Experience**

I understand that Nooworks works with individual artists on a rotating basis to offer unique prints and items. However I was still shocked to see that the pieces were being sold for $100+ especially considering many items are rayon and jersey.

While I can live with the price to get a unique print - what really sucks is that there never seems to be any free shipping promos offered. Nor are there any options for free returns. Which again, is rough considering that you most likely are spending over $100 per order. 

While Nooworks now has a return form and [store credit option](https://www.nooworks.com/a/returns), this is relatively new. For my first orders I had to pay for shipping and return shipping and then shipping again for a new ""exchange"" item. And back then (a few months ago) you had to email an individual to request that your return be granted in the first place.

**Quality -** [PHOTO ALBUM](https://imgur.com/a/548aBLY)

This is the biggest let down for me. I love the prints that Nooworks offers and found them unique enough to justify the price. I also value supporting artists. But at $100+ I don't understand how the clothes themselves can be rife with such poor craftmanship. Now I am not a seamstress but I know that wonky hems and loose threads are not good markers of quality.  Each and every single item I have ordered from Nooworks has had these issues. 

I didn't take any photos of the two items I returned but the above photo album showcases examples from the three pieces I did keep. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Overall**

I love what Nooworks offers but they make me really sad. I really don't think it's fair to sell this idea of ""unique pieces supporting women and artists"" but deliver such poorly made items. I'm still conflicted about whether or not I will continue supporting the brand. The maximalist in me love the prints but the practical and reasonable side of me can't justify the price for the quality I get. 

If anyone has any alternative brands/shops, I'd love to know more!",Review: Noowork's craftsmanship and quality

385,femalefashionadvice,"   Whenever I talk to my girlfriends about swimsuits they always seem really adamant the once pieces are ugly and something that ""Only old people wear"" but I always beg to differ. 

Aside from a two piece set that I bought online last year, one pieces have always seemed to be the way to go for me personally. They just feel really solid whenever I go swimming with them on and I tend to feel less self conscious whenever I wear one since they tend to be fuller coverage around the bottom and bust. If my mom (40I) and my older sisters ( \[19\] 36H, 36F &amp; 36DD) are any indication I'm likely to get a lot bigger in the next few years (\[currently 13\] 34C), sigh, so they might be my only choice anyway. Besides just providing fuller coverage when swimming they also tend to hold the bust more securely. Overall even the accusation that they look bad is total BS as well, I bought several Once pieces from speedo online and they look great. One of them is a royal purple color and the other two have this really cool psychedelic looking pattern. In the end I don't think I'll ever understand why the prejudice against one pieces exists in the first place.

I'm definitely trying to be more sustainable in my shopping habits, so I tend to stick to thrifted clothes for the most part, but there are obviously places where thrifted doesn't cut it, particularly with clothing that serves a particular purpose (eg; repelling water, appearing professional, supporting my feet when I'm standing or walking all day).  All of this makes me think about the *why* behind what I put on my body every morning (or evening) when I get dressed.  There is a strong element of direct function, but there are many other intangible factors at play that influence what exactly it is that I choose from all the different clothes that I own.

So, my questions to you are:

* What goals are you considering when you choose outfits, buy clothes, and generally dress yourself? Are you considering self-expression, dress code at work, suitability for weather and activities, impressing your peers, being part of a group, or something else?

* What are the respective proportions of function and fashion going on in your wardrobe, and where do the two intersect?


For myself, I think there are a lot of conflicting goals happening at once.  For example, this morning I got dressed to meet a friend for brunch.  I wanted to look cute and trendy, but I also needed to balance that with my method of transportation (cycling) and the weather (fall, so could skew warm or cool unpredictably).  The outfit I ended up seemed to satisfy each of my goals half-heartedly.  I settled on crop flare jeans which ended up catching in my bike chain, low heeled boots that I was afraid of scuffing, a pretty cotton blouse that got covered by my corduroy jacket and hoodie for warmth, vintage earrings (one of which I almost lost on the ride home), and a bright pink lip for contrast. If I had only had the goal of looking cute, I probably would have chosen different bottoms, and I would have worn a long vintage trench.  If I only had the goal of cycling, it would have been track or yoga pants and a windbreaker.

So that brings me to the second question, which is the intersection of function and fashion in your clothing choices.  I have slowly been spending money on more practical wear (rain jacket, yoga pants, hiking boots, etc), but at the same time when I review my wardrobe, a large portion of it is vintage blouses, dresses, jackets, and hats that rarely get worn because, even though I love them, they just aren't  that functional.  I don't feel bad about buying things I rarely wear because almost all of it is secondhand, but at the same time it is eternally frustrating to own so much beautiful clothing and still feel like a frump during my daily activities.

427,femalefashionadvice,"Monday is the first day of my first practicum for the Education Assistant program I'm in, and I'm starting to get nervous about my wardrobe. The school principal has told me to dress in a way that's ""comfortable and casual"", but I usually wear jeans, t-shirts, and Toms or low top Converse (or my Docs if it's raining/snowing out), and while this is fine for my day-to-day, I feel like it's a bit *too* casual to wear as an educator.

The other end of my wardrobe tends to be super dressy, which is also inappropriate for the classroom. I need to find some in-between clothes - things I can move around comfortably in, and that are easy-care and relatively inexpensive.

I want to keep jeans out of my wardrobe for the first week, until I have a feel for what the dress code is at the school. Almost all of my normal shirts are basic tees (a few with long sleeves), and my office-casual shoes all have heels that are too high to be comfortable if I'm on my feet for 7 hours a day. So right now I'm working with a pair of burgundy pants, a few different pairs of black slacks, an assortment of sweaters and cardigans (with nothing to wear under them except t-shirts), and [these boots](https://marks.scene7.com/is/image/marksp/260667_5DQBDHFB9-2105_PROD_1_BLACK). My practicum is four weeks long, and I can see this getting repetitive really quickly!

So, educators, what do the EAs/SSAs/SEAs/etc. in your school typically wear? (I'm going to an elementary school if that makes a difference, although my *next* practicum will be in a high school.) Any key pieces that I should invest in? Anything that I should definitely avoid?

438,femalefashionadvice,"Title gore? Anyway, I have some trash bags full of clothes that I don‚Äôt need anymore and I thought about selling them in bundles but they‚Äôre not worth enough to resell anyway. So I thought about donating them to my nearest goodwill but...they‚Äôre going to resell them too and I was going to do that anyway. Now I know they‚Äôre a charity and donating will help somehow, but I learned that only a small percentage of the proceeds actually go to help their cause. Also some customers buy the clothes and if it‚Äôs a good/decent brand they‚Äôll resell it themselves on poshmark or wherever and mark up the price. So what am I going to do with my clothes? What should YOU do with the clothes you don‚Äôt want anymore? 

Donate them to people that will actually use them! You can donate to a women and children‚Äôs shelter, crisis shelter or those places where you can donate your professional clothes so that homeless men and women can use them for job interviews. This way you know that 100% of what you give will actually help a person enhance their lives. I myself sometimes couldn‚Äôt afford new shoes and new clothes during school and I had to wear tattered shoes and clothing until one day my high school had a little ‚Äústore‚Äù that had free uniforms, free shoes and even free toiletries like brand new deodorants, tampons, pads, and shampoos etc! 

If you‚Äôre also an Earth Warrior and you wanna do your part to save our lovely planet you can have your clothes recycled. I know some retail stores like H&amp;M have a drop box that you can drop your clothes off and get a discount on your next purchase. Or if you have jeans/denim you can donate them at https://bluejeansgogreen.org/recycle-denim/ to get them recycled. 

So whether you‚Äôre revamping your closet or getting rid of dumb ex‚Äôs shit don‚Äôt throw them away donate to a shelter or crisis center and/or have them recycled!

# Rules

* Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but [keep it constructive/factual, and try to focus on feedback that will help the person improve based on their goals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3jfxk8/how_to_give_and_receive_constructive_criticism_a/)
* Link directly to images on Imgur or anywhere else you care to host them as long as the URL ends in .jpg or .png. Please don't link to Instagram posts or blog posts for your photos. You're welcome to include a link to your IG in your post, but people should not need to go to your blog/feed to see your outfits. See [Rules on Blogger Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/rules) for the full description of FFA's rules.
* Don't downvote for disagreeing with someone's opinion.

You should have at least one clear photo showing your whole outfit in a neutral pose (if you want to share more in fun poses or share detail pics that's fine too, but we should be able to see the whole outfit).

It's always helpful to other users if you provide some context on what you wore the outfit for and what your goals were. If you want to write more about your outfit creation process or what inspired you, that's great! But 1-2 sentences is fine too. For example, ""It's raining here and I wore this to run errands.

# Themes for this week are Supernatural/Horror and Copycat

## Supernatural/Horror

Are you one of the (many) many people on ffa who not so secretly want to dress like a witch? This theme's for you. Or perhaps you'd like to stray a little bit and go for some other supernatural creature. Maybe something with a high dramatic neckline (to invoke a [vampire](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/9m8yw8/inspiration_mutedmodern_every_day_vampire_look/))? Or you could try and get direct inspo from a specific character (Freddy Krueger's iconic striped sweater? The Shining twins? Wednesday Addams? Michael Jackson's thriller outfit? etc.) I don't really watch much horror so I can't really name too many things here.

### Obligatory witch subsection

I'm not collecting all the witch albums like I did with the sci-fi ones. There are so many. Probably someone is making one right now. Have a browse from the [search results](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=witch&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).

Here are some selected albums. Feel free to share your own favorites in the comments.

* [Odd Details](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/5sb3la/odd_details_and_blackredroses_two_inspiration/) (maximalist/runway looks with a creepy vibe)
* [My Grandmas was Brujas](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/8rsfdf/my_grandmas_was_brujas_an_afrowitch_inspiration/)
* [Goth Dolly Parton](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/6zhabd/goth_dolly_parton_an_inspiration_album/)
* [Storybook Fall](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/92vydn/storybook_fall_aka_wearable_witch_style_the_sequel/) (casual with witchy vibes, but with less black)

Do not turn this into an argument about whether such and such style counts as witchy or that the ONLY REAL WITCH STYLE is 1600s excommunicated Puritan garb or Stevie Nicks' outfits.

For further reading, please see the various perspectives and articles linked in [""Why are we on FFA so incredibly obsessed with witches?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/90ajsx/why_are_we_on_ffa_so_incredibly_obsessed_with/) (turns out it is in fact not just FFA, though it's certainly amplified here)


## Copycat

*Good artists copy, great artists steal.* Shamelessly copy an outfit, whether it's from a classic Pinterest look, an instagrammer's ootd, or an outfit you saw in WAYWT. Please include a link to your inspo picture. What styling details did you use to bring your outfit closer the look, or what intentional changes did you make to suit it to your (life)style?

Looking back, I've suffered from depression for a long time. I was never interested in how I dressed or how I looked, I've never bought or used makeup, and I tended to wear what was comfiest (stretchy pants and graphic tshirts). I've never had the habit of blowdrying my hair after showering and it's only within the past few years I've gotten into the habit of brushing my hair on a regular basis before going out. 

I've been through extensive treatment and I'm now in a place where I really do want to look and feel good about how I look and dress. I'm also starting to get interested in dating but feel like I really don't dress or groom myself well enough for it to not seem like a joke. 

I just don't know where to start. It seems like such an overwhelming task, and I'm years behind my peers. Where do I start to shop? How many pants/shirts/outfits should I buy to start with? How much do I budget to start? What is a reasonable budget? How do I find something that I like and looks good on me? I'm feeling pretty lost and I feel pretty upset/ashamed when I think about it so I would appreciate some help. Thanks.",How to start making a wardrobe? I've never dressed fashionably before

Sorry for formatting, I‚Äôm on mobile. I‚Äôve always had trouble shopping for clothes. It‚Äôs usually my absolute lowest priority, and I‚Äôve always been inclined to think clothes were  ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù (which sounds crazy, I know). In college, I wore the female college uniform of leggings, oversize T-shirts, athletic shorts, and jeans so I very rarely bought new clothes. The ones I did buy were all from places like Charlotte Russe, Forever 21, H&amp;M, etc and needed to be tossed out either because they worn out (low quality) or because I could never wear them anymore (too college like).

Now that I‚Äôm a grown-ass adult women, I need to invest in some adult clothes for work and otherwise (It feels wrong to wear my old college outfits to outings anymore). Maybe my style is changing as I mature, but I need to invest in some new clothes. 

This is probably a silly question, but what are appropriate prices to pay for individual items? I‚Äôm on a semi-tight budget (student loans) but I make decent money and am not opposed to paying ‚Äúnormal‚Äù prices for clothes (new, good quality clothes from reasonably priced stores).

46,femalefashionadvice,"Hey there FFA!

I grew up competing in Irish Dance. It's a whole subculture unto itself, and as I've grown up and moved further away from my Irish Dance community, I've found that the form is pretty obscure to the world at large! Unless you or someone you know is involved in Irish Dance, you might never encounter the *highly specific* dress/lingo/culture.

Irish Dance saw a global boom in the '90s after Riverdance, Lord of the Dance, and other big-budget shows exploded into the public consciousness. It went from a heritage activity that was mostly limited to Irish and Irish-expat communities to a worldwide phenomenon. Thousands of kids wanted to learn to dance, and schools sprang up all over the world to meet the demand. While Irish Dance spectacular-type shows still tour (Riverdance is entering its 25th season), there has been a marked shift away from show dancing and towards competition, with critical masses of competitors in Ireland, the UK, the USA, and Australia. 

And that's where I'm picking up with this inspo album. Competitive Irish Dance fashion has evolved rapidly, and become a juggernaut of an industry. Until the early aughts, female competitors at the highest levels wore one-of-a-kind, velvet solo dresses, heavily embroidered with traditional knotwork designs from the Book of Kells, usually handmade by their mother or grandmother. As Irish Dance became more popular, dresses became, well, more *extra*. Many competitive Irish dancers these days, particularly at the championship level, pay $1,00-4,000 for a new crystal-encrusted solo dress every year. Big-name dressmakers like [Conor O'Sullivan](https://www.instagram.com/conorosullivandesigns/?hl=en), [John Carey](https://www.instagram.com/johncareydesign/?hl=en), and [Gavin Doherty](https://www.instagram.com/eiredesigns_official/?hl=en) have a corner on the market. Enormous curly wigs, crowns, darkly tanned legs, and high-definition makeup are the norm. 

The newer look has seen censure from those who think that the intense costuming distracts from the dancing instead of augmenting it. Regulations in recent years have restricted use of bling, makeup, and fake tans for younger dancers. There has also been a movement where competitors choose to dance in ""blackout"", a simple black leotard and skirt, rather than the full look. 

All of this to say that the competitive Irish Dance fashion subculture is controversial, eye-catching, and very interesting to me as someone who likes clothes. There is a fine, fine line between breathtaking and overwhelming, and Irish Dance costumes walk it hard.

I made this inspo album with the intention of finding parallels between the very specific Irish Dance look and high fashion. Common threads include:

\-Fitted bodice with a short skirt, high neckline, and long sleeves (adherence to this silhouette is governed by international regulations)

\-Crystals!!! All sizes, shapes, and colors, all at once. Blinding in some lights. 

\-An entire lack of subtlety-- these costumes are meant to catch and hold a judge's attention. Neon, sequins, 3-dimensional designs, high-saturation colors, and powerful elements like capes, crowns, and epaulets get the job done.

\-Use of applique, lace, and embroidery

\-Themes like fire, ice, floral, or rainbow that elaborate on abstract deisgns

I tried to balance pictures of actual Irish Dance dresses, whether in action or on display, with runway looks. Special mention for supermodel Coco Rocha who grew up Irish dancing, was spotted by a modeling scout at a feis (Irish dance competition), and has been known to dance down runways from time to time.

So join me, friends, in basking in the glow of stage lights reflected in entirely too many crystals.

51,femalefashionadvice,"So for most of my life, I did not like '70s fashion. I vastly preferred the silhouettes and colors of the '60s (all those gorgeous pastels!). Whenever I saw '70s fashion, it always seemed like a weird mix of grimy and rainbow. Rainbow tie die, loads of fringe, too much mustard yellow, lots of itchy and heavy fabrics which clung to the smells of cigarrettes and sweat... 

Yeah. Not for me lol. 

But recently, Dr. Wendy Carr off of Mindhunter has made me fall in love with '70s fashion ‚Äì specifically, HER version of '70s fashion. As far as I can see, it involves lots of silky blouses, pussy bow blouses, high-waisted midi skirts, over-the-knee boots with midi skirts and dresses, long trench coats, and lots of delicious neutral and earthy colors with '70s twists: cream, gold, dark teal, honey, mossy green, and so on. The silhouettes and colors are a lot prettier than the other '70s fashion I always saw. 

I was also heavily inspired by the Richard Allan x H&amp;M collab, which is gorgeous and very '70s (with a little bit of '60s thrown in as well!) in a very wearable way.

Walking around the city, I see some killer outfits/pieces and I'm always intrigued about where they got it. Might be thrifted, some expensive luxe brand, or sometimes even custom! Especially around nyc, there are so many foreign brands I get introduced to daily this way. I'd say this is the primary way I end up discovering new brands.

But yesterday I was talking to a friend and he said that he never has the same curiosity. Instead, he'll keep tabs on certain designers and check out their new collections. And he follows certain bloggers/IGs that post about up and coming designers or new drops. Once his interest is peaked, that's when he'll *actually* go and try to find what the clothes looks like.

I thought this was super interesting because it's like the inverse approach to discovering new stuff (mine starts with the clothes and ends with the designers, and his starts with the designers and ends with the clothes). 

I honestly haven't followed a blog/youtuber/brand in a long time and this never occurred to me. It's kind of an odd question but I thought it might be interesting to hear your guys' thoughts.

WAYWT (""What are you wearing today""), but with themes! Share some inspiration photos, float your outfit ideas, and discuss this week's themes here! The goal is to have some fun creating outfits in a slightly more focused way, not to win a contest on Who Can Be The Most Theme.


# Themes for this week are Supernatural/Horror and Copycat

## Supernatural/Horror

Are you one of the (many) many people on ffa who not so secretly want to dress like a witch? This theme's for you. Or perhaps you'd like to stray a little bit and go for some other supernatural creature. Maybe something with a high dramatic neckline (to invoke a [vampire](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/9m8yw8/inspiration_mutedmodern_every_day_vampire_look/))? Or you could try and get direct inspo from a specific character (Freddy Krueger's iconic striped sweater? The Shining twins? Wednesday Addams? Michael Jackson's thriller outfit? etc.) I don't really watch much horror so I can't really name too many things here.

### Obligatory witch subsection

I'm not collecting all the witch albums like I did with the sci-fi ones. There are so many. Probably someone is making one right now. Have a browse from the [search results](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=witch&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).

Here are some selected albums. Feel free to share your own favorites in the comments.

* [Odd Details](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/5sb3la/odd_details_and_blackredroses_two_inspiration/) (maximalist/runway looks with a creepy vibe)
* [My Grandmas was Brujas](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/8rsfdf/my_grandmas_was_brujas_an_afrowitch_inspiration/)
* [Goth Dolly Parton](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/6zhabd/goth_dolly_parton_an_inspiration_album/)
* [Storybook Fall](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/92vydn/storybook_fall_aka_wearable_witch_style_the_sequel/) (casual with witchy vibes, but with less black)

That being said: LET PEOPLE ENJOY THEIR OUTFITS. FFS it's the last week of October and it's theme WAYWT. Do not turn this into an argument about whether such and such style counts as witchy or that the ONLY REAL WITCH STYLE is 1600s excommunicated Puritan garb or Stevie Nicks' outfits.

For further reading, please see the various perspectives and articles linked in [""Why are we on FFA so incredibly obsessed with witches?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/90ajsx/why_are_we_on_ffa_so_incredibly_obsessed_with/) (turns out it is in fact not just FFA, though it's certainly amplified here)


## Copycat

*Good artists copy, great artists steal.* Shamelessly copy an outfit, whether it's from a classic Pinterest look, an instagrammer's ootd, or an outfit you saw in WAYWT. Please include a link to your inspo picture. What styling details did you use to bring your outfit closer the look, or what intentional changes did you make to suit it to your (life)style?


* [Previous FFA thread of copycat looks](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/8s8vbe/copy_cats_post_your_pinterest_or_other_inspired/)
* [Aprils Fools from MFA last year where everyone dressed up as each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8dfqjq/themechallenge_waywt_april_fools_041918/)

92,femalefashionadvice,"Most of the posts I found about safety wear were mostly concerned with steel-toed boots, but that's not the kind of safety gear that my job requires. So ladies, where do you buy your safety glasses and lab-safe shoes?

Safety-glasses: I mean those which are [one solid piece](https://marveloptics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GVSF1033-3-Global-Vision-Marvel-Optics-500x228.jpg), rather than separate [side shields](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-2ddb9/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/333/676/SS100_wGlass_1__37196.1438796060.jpg?c=2&amp;imbypass=on). I've browsed Zenni and FramesDirect but didn't find much, or I could have not been searching correctly. Especially for women who need prescription frames, where do you get your safety glasses? Do you opt for prescription glasses, clip-ons to your everyday glasses, or over-the-frame safety glasses?

Lab-safe shoes: Shoes do not need to be steel-toed, but they do need to be close-toed and less than 4-in heal (corporate req't, not mine) but please also **comfortable** to stand/strut/walk in for 8 hours. What shoes do you ladies recommend, especially if you want to still wear heels? Specifically not [sturdy but badass](https://www.drmartens.com/us/en/p/23932600#), which I already own and LOVE (seriously, these shoes are bomb), but more ""traditionally"" feminine type heals.

As it gets colder, the weather goes from chilly in the morning, bearable during the day, and cold at night - also, indoors tend to be significantly warmer in comparison to outside. 

How does one begin to develop a cold weather wardrobe? Specifically, shoes, warm bottoms, and layer-able tops? 

Shoes are a tough one for me personally - I've seen great recommendations here, but what about comfort? Specifically, shoes that are weather durable. I wear boot Uggs pretty much daily because they are the most comfortable thing ever, but I can't wear them in inclement weather.

Pants are another one - I opt almost entirely for leggings. I just bought some jeans, but I'm really interested in wearing more skirts without freezing my ass off. Obviously, pantyhose is an option, but any other recommendations? (Are legwarmers still a thing and how do you pull them off?)

Tops! I am honestly overwhelmed. I'm never warm enough. Sweaters vs tops and cardigans plus jackets or coats??

Now that the weather is turning colder where I live, I find myself searching for an equivalent of those linen blend pants for Fall and Winter. My jeans, which I would have turned to in the past, just seem to be so... restrictive and uncomfortable by comparison.  Is the answer different jeans?  Some kind of knit pant?

177,femalefashionadvice,"[This article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-your-next-louis-vuitton-bag-may-hail-from-texas-11571332220) is all over the place. Tl;dr: LV is opening a permanent factory in Texas. (LV has been producing goods in a temporary facility in Texas since 2017.)

Here are key points I picked out that I think are worth discussing (emphasis mine, ellipses excluded for readability):

&gt;Unlike Louis Vuitton products from France, the Texas bags won‚Äôt be produced by ‚Äú*petites mains*,‚Äù the French artisans at the center of the brand‚Äôs history and mystique. Instead, Louis Vuitton is recruiting and training employees locally, **no experience needed**. Candidates passing drug and manual-dexterity tests can join the line with starting hourly pay of **$13**.

&gt;‚Äú[The facility] was literally a sweatshop,‚Äù‚Ä¶ Another employee filed a complaint alleging the **lack of air conditioning** and other working conditions were a form of discrimination against the Hispanic and female workforce.

Northeast Texas in the summer easily reaches 100 degrees.

&gt;Brands across the industry have long promoted their old-world craftsmanship to justify high prices. Herm√®s produces exclusively in France, where one worker oversees a single bag. [LV] divides bag construction into steps... Some teams select and cut leather. Others attach linings or sew together pieces of leather... ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like what you hear, this fiction‚Äîthe same motions, on the same bag, for an entire life of the worker,"" says Louis Vuitton‚Äôs Mr. Burke. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really a romantic myth.‚Äù

&gt;[LV is] testing one of the luxury industry‚Äôs core tenets‚Äîthat a luxury product must be made where it was conceived.

&gt;Brands across the industry have long promoted their old-world craftsmanship to justify high prices‚Ä¶ Louis Vuitton‚Äôs strategy is to sell luxury goods to the masses without lowering prices.

&gt;Louis Vuitton *licensed* its name to a U.S. manufacturer in the 1970s... ‚ÄúWe are moving from a mass market‚Ä¶‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúIt is an art form to maintain your company values and standards when you start expanding outside your home country,‚Äù says Louis Vuitton Chief Executive Michael Burke. ‚ÄúMost companies fail at that.‚Äù

Licensing runs the risk of brand mismanagement or poor quality control - I'm actually surprised and impressed that QC or brand dilution hasn't come up before this. Typically a brand will license their product to reach the masses or to more easily mass produce their product. LV is banking on licensing out their product to result in a more agile supply chain that should be able to respond to microtrends in specific areas.

&gt;Sales at Louis Vuitton‚Äôs stores are up double digits this year, Mr. Burke says.

&gt;The gold-and-brown bags, priced at $1,200 and up, will be tagged ‚ÄúMade in the USA.‚Äù ...For now, it plans to ship in raw materials from European suppliers, but would like to start buying U.S. leather.

#Discussion points (don‚Äôt feel limited to these - go off):

* We've always defended the price luxury goods by saying the people making them are masters of their craft who are paid fair wages for their valuable skills. Breaking the bag down into a production line, paying workers $13 an hour starting, and no experience required is a huge contrast to this narrative. This article doesn't detail how long it takes to make a bag, but [this article](https://www.buro247.me/fashion/news/this-is-how-long-it-took-to-make-the-three-new-han.html) says it takes about 3-4 hours to assemble the more complicated bags like Dauphine and Trapeze (so about $50 to assemble in Texas). Is the $1,200 price tag still justified? 

*  Do you think that a bag can be considered luxury if the brand licenses out production? Do you think the retail price of luxury goods can be justified if petites mans no longer produce said goods? Do you think that the item is still luxury if it's no longer made where it was conceived?

* Does ""Made in the USA"" make you more likely to purchase a product? Would you pay a premium for a luxury good made entirely in the US (raw goods like leather included)? Is moving production from France a downgrade, or does it benefit the local economy?","""Luxury"" Goods - LV shifts some production to workers who only need to pass a drug and dexterity test, paid $13/hr"

191,femalefashionadvice,"I remember when I was a kid a read a book, the name is long gone, and the main character had a defined palette.  She only wore red, black, and white.  

I thought that was really interesting, and it inspired me to get sheets in that color palette. This idea always stuck with my in home decor. 

But it wasn‚Äôt till my late 20s I decided to do it got my clothing.  I had always gravitated to a few colors, but would always try a new color and it never seemed to stick.  The wrong new color would never get worn.  

I did a little audit and started to define my palette. My most worn clothing was black, grey, black and white patterned, and pink - mostly dark fuchsia but neon pink was ok sometimes too.  I typically liked charcoal and light greys. The patterns were black with white or cream. 

Then when I went shopping and judged everything on the basis of looking good with two of those.  

What got eliminated: navy, brown, and camel.  I really can‚Äôt really make those shades work.  

I eventually felt a bit limited, and I really liked the cobalt blue trend so I added that. Cobalt looks great with pink as well.  I also liked burgundy/oxblood. Especially for accessories and added that too. 

And 85% of my wardrobe falls into this palette.  This has been constant for me for 12+ years. I do have a few outliers, but these rules really help me stay edited. I have opened up to lighter pinks and now have a few. I have a few patterned items with pink and yellow.  I do kinda like leopard and have also added some items off and on.  I also return to my old love purple from time to time.  

What really happened is people now associate pink items with me. And it has finally translated to my small leather goods (wallets, card holders) and other accessories (pens, water bottles).  And things feel more cohesive for me.

I always bring a sweater/blazer but I sometimes lose it because I‚Äôm so warm. I am 27 and I have an hourglass shape. But the clothes I wear- they fit me well. They will show my shape. Everyone I work with has children my age. 

But I will have thick straps to mostly cover the shoulders; dress/skirts that hits right above my knee with short sleeves, and a jacket on top if I show my legs. Sometimes I‚Äôm too warm so I always wear a work appropriate sleeveless/short sleeve blouse so I can lose the jacket and not appear unprofessional. I like prints. 

The women I work with- are about my mom‚Äôs age and older.  One of them think that the only way to look professional is dark pants and a dark blazer.  Jackets are nice sometimes and do look better. 

But sometimes I‚Äôve done the super black suit and it just doesn‚Äôt look age appropriate. It makes me look really old and I don‚Äôt think it fits my style or my age. Sometimes a girl just has to lose the jacket. I am running around all day. It makes me look 40.

The blatant ripoff alongside with the caption "" n a sea of uninspiringly named ‚Äú\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ + \_\_\_\_\_\_\_‚Äù brands comprised of re-labeled Alibaba imports and wholesale market finds ..."" made me hesitant on repurchasing from this brand again but then I just forgot about it.

Sometimes I do find their clothes looking way too familiar with the ones I saw on websites like Kooding bt I couldn't confirm my hunch until recently when I started doing some Winter online shopping again and THESE ARE THE EXACT SAME DRESSES albeit Oak+Fort offers 2 sizes instead f 1 but just LOOK AT THEM!!! I didn't even try looking for them not like I got beef with o+f but just LOOK AT THE DETAILS!!!

LOOK AT THE DETAILS THEY'RE THE EXACT SAMEEE

btw I also saw this on Oak+Fort website but I can't find the link it was so long ago, but there's the Korean website:

[https://www.kooding.com/sweet-sailor-blouse/p/200095](https://www.kooding.com/sweet-sailor-blouse/p/200095) 

\-

anyway I know they're not exactly Cheap cheap but they're definitely more affordable on these Korean websites; why not save yourself some money for shipping + more clothes if you're buying in a large-ish quantity?

It‚Äôs no secret that fast fashion companies aren‚Äôt designing and producing all of their own goods. Many stores will buy stock from a variety of sources which they think will sell well in their store. However most of the time the prices for a given piece will be very similar across all retailers so it‚Äôs not too noticeable. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised that they tried to mark it up so much but I‚Äôm still a little... taken aback by it? $70 compared to $30 is quite a difference.

I am def considering purchasing it off of aliexpress after really wanting it from Zara and will be scouring the internet before I make online purchases from now on.

I wore a shirt the other day that has fruit on it, and got several compliments.

# Rules

* Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but [keep it constructive/factual, and try to focus on feedback that will help the person improve based on their goals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3jfxk8/how_to_give_and_receive_constructive_criticism_a/)
* Link directly to images on Imgur or anywhere else you care to host them as long as the URL ends in .jpg or .png. Please don't link to Instagram posts or blog posts for your photos. You're welcome to include a link to your IG in your post, but people should not need to go to your blog/feed to see your outfits. See [Rules on Blogger Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/rules) for the full description of FFA's rules.
* Don't downvote for disagreeing with someone's opinion.

You should have at least one clear photo showing your whole outfit in a neutral pose (if you want to share more in fun poses or share detail pics that's fine too, but we should be able to see the whole outfit).

It's always helpful to other users if you provide some context on what you wore the outfit for and what your goals were. If you want to write more about your outfit creation process or what inspired you, that's great! But 1-2 sentences is fine too. For example, ""It's raining here and I wore this to run errands. I was inspired by the color scheme and attitude of [this bird](https://i.imgur.com/bSSMVYh.gifv)""

# Themes for this week are Sci Fi and Denim

## Sci Fi

It's the future (or at least the imagined future) and of course you're not going to dress like 21th century plebs. You must boldly go where no real-life fashion has gone before. Imagine how fabrics, cuts, and styling details will have changed! Maybe you're a [desert scavenger](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pgu3nKc8vMY/maxresdefault.jpg) on a remote planet, or a [lonely city dweller](https://fashnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Blade-Runner-2049-Reimagined-by-.jpg) in a dystopia where more robots than people exist. Corporate still exists, but now it's [spaceship corporate](https://imgur.com/a/WQdAn), with futuristic angles and futuristic functionality.

There are SO many ways sci fi can be interpreted. Some of the best inspo can be found in the huge variety of costumes from movies and television. Some to consider/jog your memory:

251,femalefashionadvice,"I know. Sweatpants, snatched enough to wear outside and not look overly slobby. Bit of an oxymoron, but it's a throw off of athleisure without me really wanting to commit to the sporty look (like the Adidas tiro pants) and maybe more of a preppy/casual look. Snatched would basically be nothing overly baggy and cutting a decent, flattering silhouette, with a material that isn't overly prone to wrinkling, pilling, or attracting every pet hair in a hundred mile radius. Something that would basically blend in if worn with otherwise nice clothes,  yup. 

I looked this up but I saw a trend of really expensive sweatpants being thrown around and...well, I'm sure they're cool and all, but I've seen a lot of my real nice well made clothing (including those recommended here) ending up wearing out within 2 years anyway.

336,femalefashionadvice,"I‚Äôm a nanny, and a dog owner, and live in central London where I walk almost everywhere. Our weather is (if you‚Äôve not heard) RAINY like it‚Äôs gonna rain most days from now till March, and tbqh probably a good 40% of the Spring &amp; Summer.

Last winter I bought a pair of Vans MTE high tops and thought they were perfect. They‚Äôre made of suede and leather, rainproof, warm, and had a good grip on the sole. I say had because after one winter.... it‚Äôs gone. Like worn down into a slippery mess. 

The only pair of ‚Äòcasual‚Äô shoes I have that‚Äôs lasted more than one season are my Dr Martens ‚ÄòFor Life‚Äô which are 2 years old and going strong. Sadly they don‚Äôt go with every outfit and arent quite as flexible as I need a day to day shoe to be.

337,femalefashionadvice,"The only clothes I ever buy new are underwear &amp; hosery. Everything else is second hand, from charity shops, thrift shops, kilo sales, Ebay &amp; Depop. Its significantly cheaper, great for the environment, and I rarely see people wearing the same outfit as me. 

It also enables me to buy much more ""luxurious"" stuff than I can afford, for example, leather boots, 100% cashmere sweaters &amp; wool trousers. I particularly enjoy thrifting animal products as they are not something I would feel comfortable with buying new. 

I'm really struggling to see why people buy stuff new?

I guess I am lucky to be a student in a metropolitan city, in that I have easy access to second hand stores, and I suppose for those who must appear particularly smart and well groomed for work, buying second hand might be risky.

my own breakdown:

* **shirt: $106.00** saint laurent hedi slimane x grimes 2013, bought off poshmark secondhand
* **pants: $40** abercrombie and fitch black skinny jeans from like 2013
* **shoes: $65** old skool fans pro
* **jewelry: $1,460** 4 rings and a necklace
* **jacket: $0** free grey oversized bodega bay hoodie, it was a hand me down from a friend

**total:** **$1671**

personally i was shocked by how high this total is and i realize that i shouldn't have judged the girls in the videos so quickly for having such ""basic"" and expensive outfits since our highest costs are actually the same- jewelry. also, it raised some interesting questions about cost per wear. ironically the item i've worn the least is actually the most expensive- my t shirt (although to be fair i only got it three days ago). i have worn my 6 year old skinny jeans the most- way more than 40 times, and my ratty hoodie the second most.

With the October theme WAYWT themes going on, from fantasy to the actual ""recreate an outfit"" challenge coming up, I have been thinking a lot about my different fashion influences. One who always comes up is Kate Bush. Sure there is a bit of a boho witchy Stevie Nicks thing going on, but Kate Bush dips into so many areas of style that it is difficult to come up with a singular way to describe her style. It's about performance. It draws from dance. It is cozy and comfortable. It is menswear inspired. It is absolutely over-the-top. It's a preraphaelite painting. Sometimes it's even a little punk. It's so much about the body, but none of her looks are what I would describe as overtly sexy. There is careful curation to the movement, color, pattern, material, the way things come together. Everything pushes the limit of real world wearable and fantasy Kate Bush music video land. 

I did not include contemporary runway looks or specific clothing items on sale now. However the [Samantha Pleet](https://samanthapleet.com/) fall collection screams Kate Bush (can't wait for a sale!). And I definitely draw from my small collection of [Sezane](https://www.sezane.com/us) blouses when I am feeling the Victorian-inspired puffy shirt look.

**Sci Fi**

It's the future (or at least the imagined future) and of course you're not going to dress like 21th century plebs. You must boldly go where no real-life fashion has gone before. Imagine how fabrics, cuts, and styling details will have changed! Maybe you're a [desert scavenger](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pgu3nKc8vMY/maxresdefault.jpg) on a remote planet, or a [lonely city dweller](https://fashnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Blade-Runner-2049-Reimagined-by-.jpg) in a dystopia where more robots than people exist. Corporate still exists, but now it's [spaceship corporate](https://imgur.com/a/WQdAn), with futuristic angles and futuristic functionality.

There are SO many ways sci fi can be interpreted. Some of the best inspo can be found in the huge variety of costumes from movies and television. Some to consider/jog your memory:

399,femalefashionadvice,"Hi friends! So, I‚Äôm 35 and I am a guilty consumer of fast fashion and I am ready to make a closet of quality pieces that define my style.
My issue is that after years of shopping the clearance bins, I‚Äôm not sure wear to start. I‚Äôve looked into Gilt, Saks Off 5th and some other discount designee stores, but I‚Äôm having a hard time finding pieces that I feel would fit my new found style.

Here are some quality items that I am looking for if you have any advice:

1. 100% cotton shirts, V Neck or Crew. (All my shirts get terrible stretched out necks)

2. Comfortable Leather loafers or flats.

3. Leather boots/booties that are comfortable.

4. Cigarette or slim leg dress pants.

5. Simple fitted blouses that do not have to be dry cleaned. Hand washed is not an issue.

6. Any Favorite dark wash skinny jeans.

I know these are some very specific items, but any advice would be appreciated!!!

My cream colored wrap sweater from Reiss went down from an errant curry splatter while I was making dinner. A Club Monaco shirt dress somehow picked up two bright orange spots in the middle of a work day from who knows where. My favorite blouse from Pleione (which I bought to replace my former favorite blouse from Pleione, after splattering liquid eyeliner on it) is entering retirement due to a lamb ragu grease stain that refuses to lift.

Anytime I notice a stain I immediately blot it with water or a little bit of Dawn soap if its greasy. I've tried Tide to Go pens, hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and everything else I can think of.

421,femalefashionadvice,"So I grew up very Tom boyish, all the way until I graduated college (I.e. camo from Cabelas, masculine clothing all the way around.) I didn‚Äôt grow up in a makeup friendly home, my fam called it my war paint (they‚Äôve gotten better since then. They still hate red lipstick that I love to wear haha) my mom never taught me how to be ‚Äúgirly‚Äù and neither did my step mom. 

I now work in law enforcement (deputy) and it‚Äôs obviously a very masculine job and I have dress with my hair up, not makeup ect.. 

So the last four years I‚Äôve been trying to re-vamp my style outside of work. I like being feminine and wearing dresses and heels. I struggle with finding outfits that are me. All my best friends who would shop with me, live 4-8hrs away so I don‚Äôt have anyone to give me feedback. I moved recently and completely cleaned out of my closet. So I‚Äôm starting from the bottom.

I love the edgy/chic style, but I struggle to find outfits that look good on me. I have broad shoulders and wide hips. I‚Äôve tried Sitchfix and they always miss the the mark with me. 

I would like some guidance on where to shop for the clothing styles I like that are affordable and you don‚Äôt need to be a size two to fit their clothing. (Preferably online, my state doesn‚Äôt have a broad option of shopping)  thanks for the free back, and I‚Äôm sorry if I broke any of the rules..

427,femalefashionadvice,"I lived in a very conservative town. There it was normal for people to wear shirts that focused on conservatism or Christian/Mormon religion. 

I lived in Austin, Texas for a while as well...and Austin was Austin. Lots of Bernie/Hillary/Beto tshirts. Feminist tshirts. And Black people had some really cool Malcolm X tshirts or ones that said Black Girl Magic. Latinos would have tops that said Si Se Puede on them. 

My mother's school where she worked as a teacher would never allow her to wear a [Malcom X t-shirt](https://content.buysend.com/Image/Render/423931)
[Si Se Puede](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KJdM4VOEL._SX342_QL70_.jpg) or one with

Even a Black fist necklace would be pushing it at her old place but in her new predominantly Black school, the teachers will even have Black Lives Matter or ""I Can't Breathe."" 

But I don't know if I see those shirts as the same category as a Bernie Tshirt or a Trump Hat. However, the conservatives I knew said it wasn't fair for them to not be able to wear their Republican clothing but people could wear a shirt like [Nah - Rosa Parks](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OIP.734pAGIR6ruK9rl5m41TkQHaJl&amp;pid=Api&amp;dpr=3)

My workplaces were cool with anything an everything. It was a very casual place but it was in Austin so a lot of the shirts were usually pro-LGBTQ, feminism or cultural pride. 

With this coming being a US election year, I'm sure things will continue to change and I'm curious what your thoughts are and your workplace handles it? Where do you think the line is between political/cultural attire (Like a Si Se Puede shirt) and a more strictly political shirt like ""Make America Great Again"" or ""Not Me. Us"" And what are the subtle or more concrete ways you show your beliefs through fashion?",Where do you see the line between cultural pride shirts and political shirts?

I'm looking for more than just regular blue jeans, of which the one pair I have that fits well has holes in the thigh area from the rub. I usually dress more in colors and love red. 

I'm somewhere around a 6-8p and have measurements of 27-28 waist, 38-40 hips, and each thigh is 22-23 inches, depending on my weight. I don't have a lot of money, which seems to be the issue, since the last time I bought cheaper curvy jeans from H&amp;M the crotch and thighs have basically totally rubbed off. 

currently every pair of pants I own don't fit, they are tight on my hips/ thighs, and really loose on my waist, enough that using a belt causes it to paperbag. 

I almost always thrift my clothing and can never find 'curvy' pants that fits properly, especially more professional attire. 

Can anyone offer some suggestions for fashionable pants that would be more likely to fit me? Or maybe brands that I could look out for too while thrifting!! Thanks for the help whomever is reading.",Where to find fashionable pants/ jeans for curvy women?

46,femalefashionadvice,"As much as I feel like this should be a simple question, I‚Äôve scoured the internet and read many articles and I still have yet to find any kind of definitive answer. 

Some articles say buy a half size down to stop slippage at the ankle. Some say buy a half to full size up to stop toe squish. One said to stretch the toe box with wild DIY methods and strengthen your ankles by wearing heels often. Another quoted that exact article and said it was all BS. 

What is the truth? I‚Äôm so lost!

I recently found a very cute pair of classic black pointed toe heels, but was very uncertain on sizing. I followed all of the advice of shopping at the end of the day and walking around the store in them for a bit. I usually wear a 9, but in those shoes it felt a bit too big because as my toes scooted forward my heel would pop out of the back a bit. I sized down to an 8.5, and that stayed on my food comfortably with no scooting or slippage, but I worry that the position my toes are in within the pointy part is bad for them. They are a bit tight in there, but I can‚Äôt figure out how they‚Äôre supposed to be fitting. 

The scariest part was when I came across a podiatrist discussing heels and how you need ‚Äúthe perfect fit for you‚Äù and then listing all of the terrible things that will happen to your feet if your heels are too big or too small. But she never told us the secret of finding our perfect fit.

Furthermore, women need to know that they don‚Äôt have to settle in life.  The strongest women I know don‚Äôt settle in life.  The strongest women I know keep working until they get what it is they want, and to tell you the truth, these women have also learned that they could have gotten their wants sooner had they felt empowered enough to do so.

 I am aggressively pear-shaped and have such a hard time finding bottoms that fit!

I've tried the curvy collection at Old Navy and they were the closest to fitting me properly, but I still have to buy them too big in the waist and belt them.

I'm really trying to get into clothing that fits well after years of being forced to wear oversized things. Also trying to ensure I'm buying things that are ethical, but I'm finding the task incredibly difficult.

I also feel like I can‚Äôt really rock skirts and dresses because due to a car accident I can‚Äôt wear any shoe over 2.5 inches. Sigh. Anyway I was hoping if I posted some photos of outfits I ‚Äúput together‚Äù someone could give me some advice on what I‚Äôm doing wrong and help me out. Thanks in advance.

The themes are always open to some creative interpretation, so feel free to add some thoughts around how you made the outfit ‚Äì what your inspiration was, maybe what else you tried but didn't work, what you love about it, what you're iffy on. The goal is to have some fun creating outfits in a slightly more focused way, not to win a contest on Who Can Be The Most Theme.

Announcement/Discussion threads will be posted on the preceding Tuesday with the prompts and links to the schedule.

## Themes for this week are Fantasy and Sneakers

**Fantasy**

Elves, orcs, and dwarves! Peasants and nobles! Swords and sorcery! Dungeons and Dragons! Basically a foil to the sci fi genre where magic replaces tech, and everything's set in some indeterminate version of middle ages. Some inspo: Game of Thrones, [Lord of the Rings](https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lord-of-the-Rings-Powerful-Elves.jpg), [Chronicles of Narnia](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/narnia/images/4/49/Turkdel8.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110425160117), [The Hobbit](http://www.theonering.net/torwp/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/follow-me.jpg).(Please note there is a more traditionally spooky Supernatural/Horror theme for October 26, so if you are so inclined you can save your vampire/witch/ghost inspired looks for then)

Some related inspo

* [Dragons and Knights](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/81zf22/dragons_and_knights_inspired_fashion/)
* [Wizard](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/82jt89/wizard_inspiration_album/)
* [Elves of LOTR](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/8xwnj1/inspiration_elves_among_us_lord_of_the_rings_and/)
* [Hobbits](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/d6xbzn/concerning_hobbits_an_inspiration_and_aesthetic/) Movie costume screenshots, from MFA

**Sneakers**

Show off a fit featuring your favorite sneakers. Wear em in a traditional casual or sporty look or show how you make them work in a dressier look.

# Rules

* Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but [keep it constructive/factual, and try to focus on feedback that will help the person improve based on their goals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3jfxk8/how_to_give_and_receive_constructive_criticism_a/)
* Link directly to images on Imgur or anywhere else you care to host them as long as the URL ends in .jpg or .png. Please don't link to Instagram posts or blog posts for your photos. You're welcome to include a link to your IG in your post, but people should not need to go to your blog/feed to see your outfits. See [Rules on Blogger Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/rules) for the full description of FFA's rules.
* Don't downvote for disagreeing with someone's opinion.

You should have at least one clear photo showing your whole outfit in a neutral pose (if you want to share more in fun poses or share detail pics that's fine too, but we should be able to see the whole outfit).

It's always helpful to other users if you provide some context on what you wore the outfit for and what your goals were. If you want to write more about your outfit creation process or what inspired you, that's great! But 1-2 sentences is fine too. For example, ""It's raining here and I wore this to run errands. I was inspired by the color scheme and attitude of [this bird](https://i.imgur.com/bSSMVYh.gifv)""

* Taking photos with your phone? [Read this guide.](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2iupe5/taking_outfit_photos_with_your_phone/)
* Uploading photos to Imgur? [Read this guide.](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/b52pz0/tutorial_how_to_upload_your_photos_to_imgur_so/)
  * TLDR make sure that your image/album privacy is set to hidden, not public (don‚Äôt click ‚Äúshare to community‚Äù), and not private (because then no one but you can see it).
* [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://redditenhancementsuite.com) makes it very easy to view pictures in a thread.

| October 26, 2019 | **Supernatural/Horror** Are you one of the (many) many people on ffa who not so secretly want to dress like a witch? This theme's for you. Or perhaps you'd like to stray a little bit and go for some other supernatural creature. Maybe something with a high dramatic neckline (to invoke a vampire, maybe)? Or you could try and get direct inspo from a specific character (Freddy Krueger's iconic striped sweater? The shining twins? Michael Jackson's thriller jacket? etc.) I don't really watch much horror so I can't really name too many things here. | **Copycat** *Good artists copy, great artists steal.* Shamelessly copy an outfit, whether it's from a classic Pinterest look, an instagrammer's ootd, or an outfit you saw in WAYWT.

103,femalefashionadvice,"Hello! I am looking for some of all y‚Äôall‚Äôs infinite wisdom. 

I moved to Los Angeles recently and was just offered a new position yesterday (yay!). After all the normal questions about a new job, I asked what the dress code was. It‚Äôs a creative environment, but more so on the ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù side of things. What I mean to say is, 90% of the people who work there wear jeans, T-shirt‚Äôs, and boots. 

The issue is, I‚Äôm part of the 10% doing office work. My boss straight up told me ‚Äújeans and a t shirt are fine!‚Äù  but it‚Äôs taken me years to wean myself off of that look! 

So here‚Äôs my big question- how do you usually put together outfits for such a casual setting while still looking put together and fashionable? Can you actually style outfits like that, or is there ways to tweak it? In the same vein- am I going to look like a total try hard here? Should I even care? Thanks in advance!!",How do you balance looking good against a ‚Äúcasual‚Äù dress code for work?
104,femalefashionadvice,"I was just having a think this morning. As I‚Äôm sure many of you can relate, I‚Äôm a highly conventionally attractive woman in a male environment. Despite the fact that I probably make 5x what these men make, they routinely under estimate me as the ‚Äúhot 17 year old intern.‚Äù (Hello, Kyle, I‚Äôm in my 30s!!)

Anyway, I do enjoy fashion so I‚Äôve always worn stylish but professional workwear: a Brunello Cuccinelli blazer, Theory blouse, understated Chanel bag without a flashy logo, you get the point. But lately with the constant onslaught of male attention I‚Äôve wanted to dress down a bit more without losing a sense of style. I noticed there is another woman in the office who wears only men‚Äôs clothing (or at least men‚Äôs wear inspired.) she is also attractive although not as attractive as me, I hate to say, and she tells me she doesn‚Äôt get ANY attention at work. 

So I started wondering about dressing a bit like her. Masculine blazer, pocket square, suspenders, straight leg trousers. Of course I‚Äôd have to get everything tailored but so be it.  

But it‚Äôs gotten me thinking...is it cultural appropriation for a cis Hetero woman to wear masculine clothes that are more of a staple in a gender fluid wardrobe? I‚Äôm completely serious here.  I would never wear hoop earrings or paisley due to the cultural appropriation with those items...so should we all tread lightly with gender too? Is it the same thing as a drunk white straight woman stumbling into a ‚Äúgay bar‚Äù to make someone else‚Äôs experience her own playground? 

But then on the flip side, despite being white/cis, my physical attractiveness detracts from my privilege because I‚Äôm inherently undermined over it constantly. So maybe I, more than anyone, have earned the right to dress boyish.

136,femalefashionadvice,"I see a lot of posts and comments here from people who become rightfully frustrated in the process of trying to curate their personal style. 

I get it.

**First of all let‚Äôs talk about sizing.**

Almost no one wears the same size in all bottoms, tops, and shoes, regardless of the brand. For example, I have jeans from madewell that range from size 28 to 31 and they all fit me. I have shoes that range from size 9 to 10.5. I have tops that range from medium to xl. You have to learn to stop taking sizing personally. As in betweeny(not necessarily plus size depending on who you ask but also not slim either) that‚Äôs a size 10-12, I get how soul crushing it can feel to not be able to fit your ideal number or size. I get that you feel like certain clothes are unflattering or make you look bigger just because the number is bigger than what you wanted to see. 

Again, you have to get over this. In most cases it‚Äôs all your head. You still look the same size when you wear your topshop jeans that are a bigger size than your citizens of humanity jeans as long as they fit. Wearing clothes that do not fit properly is what is unflattering. If you are caught up in your personal appearance body wise and you are genuinely unhappy with it, it is really important that you take the proper steps to fix this problem for the sake of your own happiness. I personally love /r/xxfitness and /r/intuitiveeating. However, I cannot stress this enough - you do not have to be a certain size in order to wear the clothes you like. Of course there are stores that don‚Äôt carry every size but you understand what I mean. 

We all love Pinterest on here, but I believe that spending too much time on there drooling over the bodies of the skinny fashion models does nothing positive for anyone. Most of us are not professional photographers or models with a glam squad and access to people who are master photoshoppers. Most of us are everyday people who simply got tired of looking like a slob and who want to be taken more seriously by their bosses or the people in their lives that matter to them. Most of us just want to feel good about our clothes so we can stop panicking every morning and resorting to an all black outfit because we don‚Äôt know what else to wear.

Now onto general aesthetics. Yes, this sub does seem to gravitate towards a particular style and aesthetic. A lot of the people here seem to like a more minimalist look. *That does not mean you have to dress that way*.  The whole purpose of this is to truly dress for yourself. Do not start buying things you don‚Äôt really like just to impress the people on this subreddit or because you subconsciously think it will get you more upvotes in the WAYT/recent purchases threads. It is counterproductive. 

**‚ÄùHow do I dress for my age?‚Äù**

The way that a lot of people dress in this sub is not the *right* way to dress, it‚Äôs just what they like and what works for their lifestyle. Instead of worrying about my age I find it more beneficial to focus on my lifestyle. What is your daily routine? Where do you work? If you work in a casual office in tech you probably don‚Äôt need a skirt suit. If you work in a conservative office in finance you probably shouldn‚Äôt build your whole wardrobe around a goth aesthetic. Im being extreme but you get the point. You have to consider the places you spend the most time in when you are building a wardrobe you love. I personally am a member of both this sub and /r/womensstreetwear because there are a lot of elements there that I love that I don‚Äôt see a lot here. I work in finance but in an extremely casual office. My boss wore sweatpants on Tuesday. Because of this, there is no reason for me to own super pressed tailored conservative clothes unless I just love wearing them, which I do not. Being a grown up isn‚Äôt about how much the trousers you‚Äôre wearing cost or about buying a $500 wool peacoat. 

Find influencers who wear clothes that YOU also like wearing and try not to follow certain people just because they wear all neutral colors and take aesthetically pleasing photos. I actually went on a mass unfollowing spree on both YouTube and Instagram yesterday. I got rid of all of the people who do not wear clothes I actually would like wearing, or who don‚Äôt inspire me in some way when it comes to fashion. In the age of social media it is easy to become overwhelmed by the amount of content that‚Äôs out there. I think something that is overlooked on this journey is how important it is to tailor the content on your feed so that it‚Äôs actually beneficial for you, and you don‚Äôt end up impulse buying a bunch of clothes, wasting hundreds of dollars. 

I‚Äôm saying all of this because my mindset used to be this way. I‚Äôm 26 now and when I turned 25 I suddenly thought all I could wear were neutral colors and I had to dress conservative because my early 20s were over and everything fun is apparently only for people 18-24. This is bs and there is a lot sexism intertwined into this that I don‚Äôt have the time to get into to atm.

**HAVE FUN!**
Try new things within reason. Go to a store you‚Äôd typically never set foot in and try to find something you like just for the inspo. I went to the mall last weekend and wandered into a really trendy sneaker store. I saw a pair of yeezy sneakers and ended up falling in love with the brand. I purchased my first pair. Last year you couldn‚Äôt drag me away from madewell, loft, and j crew. If I would have seen this same pair of shoes then, I would have hated them because they‚Äôre not ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù enough. 

**Last but not least - money.**

This is an expensive hobby unless you thrift most of your clothes. It is what it is. Clothes seem to be getting more and more expensive and companies are justifying this by using the excuse that consumers want higher quality items. Yes there are cheap options and some may last you quite awhile, but I tried going the super cheap route at first and it just didn‚Äôt work out.  I wasted a lot of money when I was better off getting the more expensive item. 

My advice would be to use sites like eBay, poshmark, and Depop. I always search those sites for what I am looking for before I buy the item brand new, as long as I know my size and I know that I will not want to return the item. If there‚Äôs a store you really like, sign up for their emails. There are also quite a few apps that allow you to bookmark items you want and set an alert for when the price drops. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I do not want anyone to go broke trying to look good. Set a budget for yourself and try your best to find the highest quality items that fit your budget or the items that you‚Äôre satisfied with that fit your budget. Use cashback sites like Ebates(I use it whenever I can) and if you have a credit card that has different rotating 5% back categories, try to use it to your advantage. That‚Äôs all you can really do. Personally, this hobby is really important to me and because I am able to make this work, I put some money away every month. That way, I have a fund I can dip into to buy what I want when I want to. This won‚Äôt work for everyone but ever since I started doing this, I find that im a lot less stressed out about the price of certain items. 


I hope this post helps someone. This process is not supposed to be anxiety inducing. You are allowed to change your mind about what you like. You are allowed to buy expensive items if you want them. You are allowed to buy cheap items if you want them. You do not have to wear grey and navy to prove you are an adult. Please do not take this stuff too seriously. Anyone who has the audacity to judge you harshly as a human being because of where you buy your clothes is immature and not anyone you should waste time worrying about.

&amp;#x200B;

I always see so many pretty, fashionable nameless shops/boutiques, who usually price their clothes at really high prices (say $100 for a jacket, whose quality I don't know will even last). I'm usually tempted to buy something, but I resist every time! It's a struggle to know what to buy without it being a complete financial burden.

Recently, I've wanted to adopt a semi-minimalist wardrobe (trying to avoid buying unnecessary things), such as adopting essentials I know I'll be using frequently. Which means I want those pieces to last me a long time. Does anyone know of any Japanese brands that last a long time?

A bit of background, I went to GAP and bought a couple of their reissue pocket tees  [https://www.gap.co.uk/gap/the-archive-re-issue-original-pocket-t/000644571.html](https://www.gap.co.uk/gap/the-archive-re-issue-original-pocket-t/000644571.html)  and after using them for 2 months or so, their quality has substantially degraded. I bought a black one and the color has faded and they've over stretched for some reason. Then I bought a skirt and the quality as well has taken a hit. I'm surprised, since GAP is a brand that I thought was ""up there""?  and they're not the cheapest price-wise (I actually think they're expensive tbh). I feel like many people would recommend uniqlo, but I'm not a fan of their clothes. I sometimes buy 1 or 2 pieces from GU, but only under extreme circumstances, like shit I have to dress semi-formal so I should get a decent shirt that will look good for a couple of wears, cuz I know their stuff doesn't last.

So if anyone has other feelings that hold them back aside from the ones I've listed, please feel free to add them! Especially if they found a solution for that way of thinking!

Just to make things clear: This is not a guide on ""how to wear something that might not be appropriate for the context I'm wearing it to"". If you work in finance in an incredibly stuffy office with rules, regulations, a mean boss and/or judgy clients, you're going to have to follow the explicit dress code. Sometimes these codes are implicit, and you work in a chill tech bro place where you're expected not to ever wear a tie not once not even a bowtie, or they're implicit in that no one expects to say anything to you in your manufacturing job, but there's a damn good reason everyone's wearing steel toed boots.

**I'm new to fashion and want to wear clothes deliberately, but terrified of doing this for one or many reasons**.

It's possible, when taking on any new endeavor, to be afraid because it feels like you don't have enough 'background knowledge' or knowledge of the 'rules'. You might make 'mistakes'. In this way, I would argue that fashion is similar to art- -I'm not sure there are mistakes. Maybe you'll discover that silver doesn't look good on you, or that you actually hate high socks, but you won't know until you try it on and walk around!

Doing it this way is costly though--some ways to mitigate cost are to really do research before hand\* as to what you might like, to try things on before you by them as much as you can, try to shop from places that have liberal return policies and also try to buy a cheaper version of the new thing before you spend more money on it that you'll have buyer's remorse about.

\*Think about what things you want to change and *why*. Are you trying to look more professional in the workplace? Do you want to dress in a way that expresses a unique part of your identity? Are there a certain set of adjectives you're hoping to project with your clothes (btw I rec [wardrobe architect](https://blog.colettehq.com/wardrobe-architect) for thinking about this)? When you figure out the details of what and why, the how gets easier (I can look more edgy by adding these sorts of fabric/construction details) and then you can feel confident in your choice of clothing to portray what you want and that could lessen the stress of wearing it out (I think).

It's possible that you're not actually 'scared', you're more stressed out by the idea that you'll have to spend more time thinking about what to wear. That's fair! But with all things there's a learning curve, and eventually planning outfits will become easy--or maybe you'll have curated your wardrobe in such a way that you could pull any four things together and it could work: either way the human brain thrives on making things efficient and you'll find that routines and patterns emerge naturally.

**I'm not new to fashion, but I've created this 'visual idea of myself' and I'm scared of changing it up**.

I get this. Change is hard! I'm not sure why people keep calling humans 'soooo adaptable' because change is something I think we're really good at resisting, ignoring and outright denying for the sake of continuing on even if it isn't comfortable to do so. You are working against a biological instinct here and will therefore need to give yourself every advantage against it.

1) After making the purchase or style decision or what have you that you make, say, out loud, ""I will wear this on Wednesday"" or ""I will wear this to Karen's birthday party"". It's hard to break a promise to yourself.

2) If you have friends who are going to something that you want to wear an outfit to, ask them what their outfits are and show them yours! This is an easy way to get feedback on your change and also, honestly, some happy validation from your friends, who will (if they're supportive--if not see below) tell you that you look good and psych you up to wear it. Also, now you can't chicken out.

3) Exposure therapy! Kiiinda. Wear the outfit or thing to a place no one will see you. A place you want to go but no one wants to go with you, for example, is a good one (like an art museum). Feel cool and new and shiny! Use this feeling when you wear the same/similar outfit to a regular errand. Wear it to an appropriate gathering of humans that already know you. Now you've worn it three times. It's a part of your wardrobe!

It will help here, to think about why you want to make the change you're making as well (see the above asterisk). If you can trust that you're making an informed decision, you can trust in your choice.

**Lumen, you don't get it, where I am right now, people** ***will*** **notice if I change, and they** ***will*** **be weird or mean about it.**

Fuck those people. 

But I understand that that's not useful so here's maybe a more nuanced approach.

Rule #1 (for **everyone**): **Do not fiddle. With. Your Clothes.** 

I've noticed that people comment that something doesn't 'suit' someone when that person gives vibes of discomfort with that thing, like constantly adjusting a neckline (I have a friend who was terrified of showing cleavage in one top and did it so often that before I hadn't noticed the top had a large-ish swooping neckline and then after seeing her do it 3 times I kept looking at her hands the next time she did it), constantly pulling things down, fiddling with buttons, folding up and down a shirt sleeve, general fiddling (tbh if you're a chronic fiddler it's possible no one will think this is weird?). 

Fiddle as much as you want at home. In front of your mirror. If you are wearing a button down off the shoulder or something (is this a thing cool people still do? idk) feel free to try it a million different ways, position it in any number of combinations, adjust and readjust as necessary. Feel free to even take pictures of all the looks! But once you're on the street, it's not something you're wearing. It's just a part of what you look like today and you aren't even aware of it--like your nose. It's on your face, but do you look? No! DON'T LOOK AT YOUR NOSE.

Rule #2: Posture matters.

People trying new things and feeling weird about them tend to slouch (more, if they're slouchers/a modern human in this world of needing to look down all the time). This makes clothes look like they don't fit, and makes bodies look...odd. People notice this change, and will associate it to your clothes.

Rule #3: There will always be stressful people.

People don't like change. It's why parents pick fights with kids when they're leaving home for the first (or millionth) time, it's why significant others freak out at unplanned haircuts. Change reminds them that they too need to be changing and also that they don't actually *know* you. Even if you're doing a small thing, someone might say something to bring you down or back to 'normal' because they're scared. Don't take on someone else's fear, everyone does things at their own pace and they'll get used to this new you eventually.

**Shit, Lumen, I might have a deeper problem than this**.

You're not alone! If you feel like you don't look good in the mirror in a really frequent way, if you're worried about a flaw you think you might have and feel like you have to focus your entire life and closet around it, if feelings of distress about your body (in or out of clothes) are getting in the way of your social or professional (or any adjective here) life, I think you should try talking to people (ideally a therapist!) about it. This is not an issue I'll be able to help with as a rando voice on the internet or as someone saying ""Guuuuurl just do it!!"" this is something that might take longer to unlearn, but you can unlearn it!

Hell, even if you think things about changing styles that are mean to yourself--y'know the ""I can't ever pull this off because I'm too x"" or ""this is for y people and I'm a k person"" or ""I'm not adjective enough to wear this"", you're being too mean to yourself. Everyone can try everything--the internet will ascribe different styles to different bodies, but we see those fake rules broken all the time and we love it.

Also, body dysmorphia is labeled this one ""THING"" that you either have or don't have, but I can't imagine living as a woman in the world and not existing on a spectrum of having ""unhealthy thoughts about your body looking a certain way""--I feel most of the time as though I've worked through my issues with regard to this, but then circumstances change or I hear something from someone or read something on the internet and find that I haven't perfectly gotten over *all* of it. I think someone reading this might say ""okay I think I can't pull this off, but I don't have Body Dysmorphia omg Lumen stop being overdramatic and patronizing etc etc.""--which fine, you can totes have these feelings while having a largely healthy body image thing going on--but it still isn't true that you can't pull something off and also someone else who does have BDD might express their anxieties using the same exact language, I can't tell who's generally okay but commenting on societal expectations of body, and who's really stressed or sad through the internet.

When this sort of disordered pattern of thinking is something you're grappling with ""just do it!"" might sometimes work, but it also might not. Please, DO NOT beat yourself up over not being ""confident"" enough or ""liking yourself well enough"" to wear the whatever it is that is giving you trouble! All change takes time, and changing your thoughts require more time than just changing a tee shirt. As always, I'm a big advocate for therapy. It's great. In an ideal world everyone has access to mental and physical health experts at all times, but if that's not a thing you can do there are people online who can help, and even apps made by therapists that try to make things more accessible for people! Also talk therapy isn't the only kind of therapy, remembering to spend time with friends and taking care of yourself (eating well but also happily, doing fun things with your body, looking at trees) are all important!

**Fashion is supposed to be fun, friendos**. **Let's** **have a fun time.** 

Also, as I said above, if anyone is interested in chiming in with tactics that work for them, that'd be great! This is *not* at all a comprehensive list, but idk--I thought it might be useful.",Changing your Style and Keeping Calm

204,femalefashionadvice,"Basically the title. I have jewellery I love, but I never wear it! I see people all the time with amazing stacks of friendship bracelets/leather bracelets/charm bracelets/simple chain bracelets, or layered necklaces and rings. And I adore that style! I love how it tells the story of someone's life/adventures, or something about what they love, or who loves them, displayed. 

I'm the same with rings. I love rings, but rarely, if ever, wear them. I hate the feeling and sound of rings rubbing against each other, but I love the look of a simple middle finger ring or a variety of rings on a person's fingers.

Ladies (and gentlemen) who mix, match, and stack jewellery, what are your secrets? If you were insecure like I am, what changed?

I want to layer my jade and gold rabbit necklace with my initial necklace, and mix metals with impunity!

I'm interested in being a little more technical/intentional with my fashion choices. However, I'm running into a problem. 

As I research different criteria for fashion, I keep finding I'm neutral in every category. The articles/videos always say, ""lucky you if you're neutral; you can wear anything!""

I'm neutral skin tone, I have an oval face, my hair is naturally sort of wavy (though I blow dry it straight when I want to look like I'm trying), my body shape would maybe be ""athletic"" if I tried but really I'm just in the middle zone for BMI and have not quite a boy shape but not a feminine shape.

## Themes for this week are Fantasy and Sneakers

**Fantasy**

Elves, orcs, and dwarves! Peasants and nobles! Swords and sorcery! Dungeons and Dragons! Basically a foil to the sci fi genre where magic replaces tech, and everything's set in some indeterminate version of middle ages. Some inspo: Game of Thrones, [Lord of the Rings](https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lord-of-the-Rings-Powerful-Elves.jpg), [Chronicles of Narnia](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/narnia/images/4/49/Turkdel8.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110425160117), [The Hobbit](http://www.theonering.net/torwp/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/follow-me.jpg).(Please note there is a more traditionally spooky Supernatural/Horror theme for October 26, so if you are so inclined you can save your vampire/witch/ghost inspired looks for then)

Some related inspo

[Dragons and Knights](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/81zf22/dragons_and_knights_inspired_fashion/)

[Wizard](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/82jt89/wizard_inspiration_album/)

[Elves of LOTR](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/8xwnj1/inspiration_elves_among_us_lord_of_the_rings_and/)

[Hobbits](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/d6xbzn/concerning_hobbits_an_inspiration_and_aesthetic/) Movie costume screenshots, from MFA

**Sneakers**

Show off a fit featuring your favorite sneakers. Wear em in a traditional casual or sporty look or show how you make them work in a dressier look.

I was unable to find any ffa/mfa inspo albums from recent years on sneakers but please feel free to link your favorites if you know of any. I just did a brief search for general ‚Äúsneaker inspo‚Äù in the subreddits but often searching google images/pinterest for how to style a specific type or color of sneaker will pull up better examples, particularly if it‚Äôs a specific brand/make of shoe.

| October 19, 2019 | **Sci Fi** It's the future (or at least the imagined future) and of course you're not going to dress like 21th century plebs. You must boldly go where no real-life fashion has gone before. Imagine how fabrics and cuts will have improved - but in the future! Maybe you're a [desert scavenger](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pgu3nKc8vMY/maxresdefault.jpg) on a remote planet, or a [lonely city dweller](https://fashnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Blade-Runner-2049-Reimagined-by-.jpg) in a dystopia where more robots than people exist.

| October 26, 2019 | **Supernatural/Horror** Are you one of the (many) many people on ffa who not so secretly want to dress like a witch? This theme's for you. Or perhaps you'd like to stray a little bit and go for some other supernatural creature. Maybe something with a high dramatic neckline (to invoke a vampire, maybe)? Or you could try and get direct inspo from a specific character (Freddy Krueger's iconic striped sweater? The shining twins? Michael Jackson's thriller jacket? etc.) I don't really watch much horror so I can't really name too many things here. | **Copycat** *Good artists copy, great artists steal.* Shamelessly copy an outfit, whether it's from a classic Pinterest look, an instagrammer's ootd, or an outfit you saw in WAYWT.

Elongated hourglass trans-girl needs help with adapting a fey-chicago style to be less intense/risque.

Bottom line it's been so slow to build a wardrobe that works in class and casual/business type settings that I still feel like me in.

I want something that will last for a long time. She has bought several bags over the year that just haven't held up to all the stuff she likes to carry around with her. The biggest problem she has with her bags is the straps tearing, which I think is due to that the straps are normally pleather. Anyway I would love suggestions on what has been your favorite leather bag you have had over the years. Or if you have any suggestions on how to pick out a quality bag.

I moved to a cold and wet place recently and I'm struggling to find a proper winter coat.  

Do you guys know of brands which make proper warm winter coats, which still look polished ? 

High street brands all make pretty shitty coats made entirely of polyester. They have the ""winter coat look"" but they're not winter coats.

I've been a Kasey Musgraves fan for a long time, but it wasn't until I started following her on Instagram that I realized her aesthetic was my office/casual wear goals so I've been slowly putting together an inspo board for it.

Her stylist is Erica Cloud ([Instagram here](https://www.instagram.com/ecduzit/?hl=en)).

Common themes I've noticed:

**Colors** - Blue, red, light pink, neon yellow, plus the occasional orange. Styling - Monochromatic country-disco.

**Shapes** - Sleek fits balanced against cuts made for movement (big sleeves, flouncy oversized sweaters).

**Texture** - Feathers, glitter, chiffon or bust.

**Accessories, Hair, Makeup** - Big earrings. Match the eyeshadow to your clothes and keep your lips neutral. Sleek hair but don't forget your bouffant updo at home for nights out!.

I get that technically glitter dresses and sequin blazers aren't 100% office/daytime wear, but 1) If Kasey had an office job I'm pretty sure you'd see some daytime glitter and 2) everyone's got a holiday party or two to go to!",Kasey Musgraves has an Office Job

I've been trying to get my hands on a [J.

While searching for one on Poshmark, I found a listing of [this coat](https://poshmark.com/listing/Olive-J-Crew-Topcoat-5c41026a2beb7902d6dda0b4) in my size for just $30. The seller's pictures were awful, but they had mostly positive reviews and their description promised that the coat had ""no flaws"" so I quickly jumped on it.


When I received the coat, the inner tags had all been removed and the original buttons had been replaced with uglier buttons. I was hoping to re-posh the coat if it didn't fit me, but without any tags it could be difficult, and I'd have to replace the buttons first anyway.


[Here](https://imgur.com/a/PHWjpGQ) is how the coat looks on me. I really like the way it looks on the hanger but I feel like it looks a bit ""off"" on me. It's just a touch more masculine and a tad too big than I'd prefer. I can't tell if it's legitimately just too big for me, or if it just needs to be tailored in a few areas.


I'm wondering if it would be worth it to get the coat tailored, but I've never had any of my clothes altered and I'm not sure exactly what changes should be made (aside from replacing the buttons) or how much it would cost. Here's what I'm thinking could help the coat fit me better:


1. Are the sleeves the appropriate length for a coat or do they need to be shortened for me?


2. There is padding in the shoulders - would the coat look all right if the padding was removed? I definitely think this would make the coat look less masculine on me but I'm having trouble picturing exactly how it would look. 


3. Is there any way this type of coat could be cinched in at the waist, even just in the back, to give it more of an A-line shape? It already has a bit of an A-line silhouette at the front, but from the back and sides, it looks very boxy on me which simply doesn't work for my pear-shaped figure. 


Approximately how much should I expect to pay for all of the above if it were all feasible? Depending on the cost, should I just shell out the money for the Lady Day Coat I actually want? 


Any advice is appreciated!","Should I get this coat tailored, or let it go?"

Basically, my living situation is going to be changing very soon and I'm going to have to get rid of about 1/3 of my closet - including shoes - to physically fit this new living situation. 1/2 if I can manage so I'd have space for a few new items this new living/working situation might need. The problem is that I have already decluttered my closet over and over again throughout the years and I really feel like this is an impossible task.

I already got rid of items that don't fit. I've had the same clothing size for 6+ years so there's a lot left. A lot of items are tailored to fit.  I already got rid of items that are damaged or stained or anything like that. I already got rid of items that are so incredibly low quality that I'd rather wear anything else than those. I got rid of items that were gifts from people that I wasn't wearing. I got rid of clothing that were so ridiculously outdated they looked terrible. (There weren't many of those since I've been buying a lot of basics through the years). I got rid of some novelty items that I wasn't really wearing often. I got rid of glaringly obvious doubles. My closet is organised by type (longsleeves with longsleeves, skirts with skirts, crop tops with crop tops) so when I look at it now, there's no obvious pile of, for example, 10 of the same colour and shape sweaters.

So basically, everything in my closet is something that fits, is of decent or good quality, is reasonably fashionable, and isn't double. And I still need to get rid of more.

I hate filling a landfill so I am planning on donating or selling most items which helps with the heartache of parting with items, but how do I go about this? How do I decide between items that I love both, which one I will love least? Does anyone have a strategy for this? There is no temporary storage options to put in a pile of clothing and re-examine later. The only thing I can think of is to get rid of all occasion wear (which isn't a lot of items), or super specific items like that one cosplay dress, or that one university hoodie that I wear on lazy sundays, or to really just have to blindly select and possibly regret later.

# Themes for this week are Autumn Explosion/Spring Fever and 1980s

**Autumn Explosion** / **Spring Fever**

(hemisphere-dependent) Wear that outfit that makes you so seasonally giddy that you might explode in a puff of apple cider smoke / daffodils (depending on your local season). Even if the weather isn't *quite* there yet, try and invoke the season through colors, textures, and/or accessories.

| October 26, 2019 | **Supernatural/Horror** Are you one of the (many) many people on ffa who not so secretly want to dress like a witch? This theme's for you. Or perhaps you'd like to stray a little bit and go for some other supernatural creature. Maybe something with a high dramatic neckline (to invoke a vampire, maybe)? Or you could try and get direct inspo from a specific character (Freddy Krueger's iconic striped sweater? The shining twins? Michael Jackson's thriller jacket? etc.) I don't really watch much horror so I can't really name too many things here. | **Copycat** *Good artists copy, great artists steal.* Shamelessly copy an outfit, whether it's from a classic Pinterest look, an instagrammer's ootd, or an outfit you saw in WAYWT.

That they noticeably source fabrics from the same suppliers.

This's great for timeless items but I am tired of the pervasion of cheap fabrics that get reproduced endlessly; murky colors, indistinguishable ditsy prints, shabby/drab cloths, etc from almost a decade ago. Obviously, that's a setback of mass production and it feels like there's far less opportunity to use clothes as a means of self-expression nowadays. Most people dress the same/mainstream so dressing different might get you labeled. Or you're expected to have an excuse to wear certain things. Of course, some people use their clothes to fit into their social group but what if you just want to dress different without getting judged?

Large chain producers basically sell sizes, fabrics, designs, prints, etc. that they assume people want to buy but IMHO there's a huge grey area that can be filled. Zara &amp; co. sometimes sell statement items that are easy to dress down or incorporate into daily wear like bardot collared shirts, oversized hair bows, leather overalls, maxi skirts, lace tights, etc but I wish wearing eccentric things were just more accepted and didn't get you stared at.

440,femalefashionadvice,"I'm making this as a post instead of a daily question, because the search revealed very little with respect to combining thrifting with a capsule approach. Here's an outline of the situation as I understand it, and I'm hopeful that the mass expertise in FFA can help reveal places to ease the problem points. 

**The Living Capsule Wardrobe**

The ""capsule"" wardrobe is a wardrobe curated so that the pieces in it all meet the criteria of fit, flatter and favour by the wearer. There are lots of guidelines, but the number of items and number of styles is really up to the curator. In general, the functional balance of a capsule is a combination of workhorse pieces that absorb a lot of wear (skinny jeans, LBD, a black turtleneck sweater, white tees), and impact pieces that are worn less often but express the curator's sense of style. Where that balance point is between function and impact depends on who is building the wardrobe. An ultra minimalist will tend to have mainly functional pieces, and someone with many, expressive tastes might have a large number of impact pieces. Often (but not always), a capsule wardrobe is focused on higher-quality pieces.

The ""living"" part of the capsule wardrobe is about maintenance. You've sparked joy, and filled holes, and edited, and sold and donated, and now you have a capsule wardrobe that you love. For a season, or maybe a year, the capsule is fine, but styles change and clothes wear out or meet with untimely accidents. Things need to be replaced, and sometimes on short notice. I deal with this in two ways (1) knowing well in advance what pieces I want to replace in as close to exactly as is possible (THOSE jeans, a black cardigan), and what pieces I want to replace generally (a miniskirt, but maybe in a different print, or maybe a different cut entirely) so I can keep an eye on sales; and (2) knowing what I love, so I can buy things before I have wardrobe holes (i.e. green is my best colour but comes in and out of style on a &gt; 5 year cycle. I buy green tops and dresses when I see them in pieces I like, whether I need them yet or not). These pieces absorb the wear on other clothes, extending the life of everything. It is important not to take pre-emptive shopping to excess, otherwise the capsule concept is moot, but I wouldn't be able to sustain my wardrobe on my current budget without it.

**Sustainability in Fashion**

I focus on two arms of sustainable fashion: ethical purchasing, and reducing consumption. The capsule wardrobe is great for reduced consumption, but I find myself shopping under pressure more often and having a harder time with ethical purchasing. The division between impact and functional pieces is important I think, because impact pieces lend themselves to gradual collecting, but when you have a limited number of functional pieces, being slow replacing them can make your wardrobe unworkable very quickly.

One $$$ solution for this is to find a favourite ethical brand that sells staples and fits your body, and shop from them on-demand. I think it's possible, though possibly expensive, to take care of all your staples this way. I struggle with this personally because my proportions are a bit atypical, so I find I need to try on a lot of things to find something with a good fit. There is no one-true-brand for me.

**Sustainable Purchasing through Thrifting**

The most sustainable way to purchase clothing is to thrift it - it has already been made and purchasing it consumes no new labour or resources. But, it is SO HARD to thrift a capsule wardrobe, especially the workhorse side. Here are the friction points I've identified: 

\- I wear and repair everything I buy until it is too damaged for further use, so I don't want to waste time on clothes someone else has already worn. Is this even true? Am I kidding myself because I'm lazy?

\- Thrifting with a specific goal item is a fool's errand, and the easiest way to maintain a capsule is goal-driven shopping.

\- what are the signs of a good thrift store for the capusle-minded? Curated with cool things? Or giant with find-your-own gems at good prices?

\- do basics like trousers, simple dresses, and a-line skirts even end up in thrift stores before they are in a cut/colour that is 10 years past its peak?

**TL;DR**

What I'd like to tell myself: purchasing new fast fashion is fine if you do it rarely. Urgent shopping is a bigger problem the smaller your wardrobe is, so the ethical purchasing problem is counterbalanced by simple reduction.

What I actually believe: I don't beat myself (or anyone else) up over buying fast fashion from Zara/Uniqlo/H&amp;M, but I do believe it's always important to consider how we can do better and small changes we can make.

443,femalefashionadvice,"Like most people here, I love fashion and that love has led to quite the accumulation of clothing. I‚Äôve started to thrift a lot which helps with the cost of such a habit but now I‚Äôm started to get overwhelmed by the sheer volume of clothing I have (around 200 items). The clutter stresses me out. I know this is a very first world problem, but it‚Äôs been bothering me for months now and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt have a storage system I‚Äôm happy with and I think that adds to the clutter. There‚Äôs a part of me that wants to throw out 3/4 of my clothes and just be super minimalist but my style is the opposite of that. I would honestly hate having so few options, I just get bored by the same things over and over again. 

I‚Äôve considered maybe doing monthly ‚Äòcapsules‚Äô where I put all my other clothes in garage storage save for 30-40 pieces and swap them out every month or so. I tried to come up with a 30 piece capsule but that didn‚Äôt last long as I change in what I want pretty frequently and love to just play around with clothes in new combinations. Creating a look for a day out is very fun for me but because I had already planned out all my possible looks within the capsule, getting dressed just lost its magic. I love the feeling of ‚Äúwhat am I going to wear?‚Äù and could literally spend hours just trying on different clothes in fun combinations looking for the ‚Äòperfect‚Äô look for that day. It just makes me happy. The capsule completely sucked the fun and spontaneousness out of getting dressed.

**So I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else here is super maximalist but hates visual clutter and disorganisation. What is your storage system like? How do you decided when to let go of an item?

(!!) and now that the cold weather has arrived in earnest for most of us (I've been wearing sweaters and tights in just-above-mid-40's in the AM weather here in Denver) I'm already thinking about winter fashion. 

I am **obsessed** with downtown city chic mid-late 70's looks. The big hair, the dramatic, yet soft makeup, the unabashed femininity that had so much strength and optimism behind it, the statement furs, the swishy skirts that weren't dainty or doll like, the slouchy boots, the fabrics, prints, and textiles of turn of the century Russia/Eastern European culture, the headscarves, the gritty glam. Love it all. 

There are 1-2 modern pictures here but most of this is era-specific pics that I think look as fresh as what's walking down the runway this season!

43,femalefashionadvice,"Hi everyone! 

I just received a promotion within my company (a rapidly expanding caf√© business) to marketing director. The feel of the company is very hip and modern, eco-friendly, very Instagram-able, etc., and I‚Äôm struggling to figure out how to elevate my style from activewear to appropriate, yet fashionable outfits. 

Because of the multiple locations of the caf√©s, I work mostly from home, but often have to meet with brand ambassadors, collaborators, our creative team, and my boss, both over FaceTime meetings and in person.
I want to be taken seriously upon first impression, as the youngest member of the company, without sacrificing the stylishness that our company tries to evoke. 

The women in my city and the ambassadors we meet with are generally VERY polished in terms of grooming and clothes, and often look so put together, even in the tropical heat. I moved here from a more temperate climate, so I guess my other biggest challenge is how not to look like a drowned rat when the humidity starts to hit in November. 

My current style is very casual, as I used to manage one of the caf√© storefronts. The dress code there was polished activewear (black leggings, wrinkle-free cafe T-shirt shirt, black running shoes, neat hair and makeup). When I‚Äôm not wearing black leggings I‚Äôm usually wearing denim shorts or loose black cotton pants. 

I‚Äôd like to up my game a bit more, be taken seriously by collaborators and management, without sacrificing style or going full office-wear... Any advice?",22F looking for help appearing more polished after promotion... in tropical heat!

About 6 months ago I realized that my clothes had no cohesion and we're a random assortment of blah. I got rid of everything that I didn't love or was on the fence about and now have a much smaller wardrobe. I planned to start rebuilding.

But now reality has hit. After several false starts and many returned clothes I can honestly say that I have no idea what my style is and no clue what direction to go in. I've tried Pinterest boards, I've watched YouTubers with different styles, browsed outfits on Instagram, etc. 

I think part of the problem is I'm in recovery from an eating disorder and so I plan to dress my 'aspirational' body rather than the one I have. I know that's not great but at the same time my weight is changing and I don't really want to buy clothes that may or may not fit in a few months... Or may not fit my aesthetic in a few hours when I change my mind.

**Autumn Explosion** / **Spring Fever**

(hemisphere-dependent) Wear that outfit that makes you so seasonally giddy that you might explode in a puff of apple cider smoke / daffodils (depending on your local season). Even if the weather isn't *quite* there yet, try and invoke the season through colors, textures, and/or accessories.

About a year and a half ago I was living in NYC. I saw thousands of women, and everyone had a different style, but there was one consistency: we were all wearing at least one piece of jewelry.

Now, two facts about me: 1, I LOVE jewelry. 2, I don‚Äôt have a lot of money. But cheap gold plated jewelry sucks. It wears out fast, it always turns my finger green, and I end up having to throw it away sometimes in just weeks. At the time, the only alternative I knew was actual solid gold, which obviously I couldn‚Äôt afford. And I have to think that the majority of these women I saw and the majority of us FFAers are in the same boat.

I did some research. I literally Googled ‚Äúwhat is the metal between gold plated and solid gold‚Äù and with some digging I found a material called ‚Äúgold filled‚Äù. It‚Äôs WAY more durable than plating, but not nearly as expensive as solid gold. And honestly, I felt so betrayed. It felt like the jewelry industry had been hiding this from me because SO FEW people make gold filled that most people don‚Äôt even know about it.

So I went one step further and I decided I‚Äôd make gold filled jewelry myself. IT WORKS. I wear my jewelry in the shower, when I work out, to bed. Literally life changing. I know not everyone can make their own jewelry, but it‚Äôs seriously worth your time to look into sellers who make gold filled. There‚Äôs a brand called GLDN, a handful of Etsy shops, and I started selling my jewelry as well (my brand is called RCHL, and we also just launched a Kickstarter).

I‚Äôm over dealing with throw away jewelry, and I figure you guys are too, so I thought I‚Äôd share.",‚ÄúGold filled‚Äù jewelry is worth your time.
99,femalefashionadvice,"Really desperately in need of a quality pair of black skinny jeans. I bought a pair from American Eagle at the end of last December because I had heard a lot of good things about them from friends. Well let me tell you I have not been impressed. While the jeans fit well and my blue ones have stayed nice, the black pair I bought are INCREDIBLY faded. They are genuinely a dark grey colour instead of a black it is incredibly disappointing. I even followed the rules of not washing them often and not throwing them in the dryer but still they faded after only 4 months. 
Alas, I am in search of a new actually good pair of black skinny jeans. A pair that actually stays BLACK even with the occasional wash. I am fairly cheap so I‚Äôm hoping to stay in a decent price range (I am willing to splurge a little to get an actually good pair but nothing outrageous please)!

101,femalefashionadvice,"Here's what happened, I bought a camel coat online thinking that camel wool and regular wool were more or less the same? But then the coat arrived, and it turns out...it's not lol. It is not the same at all lol. It's EXTREMELY soft and looks almost fuzzy. The blend is 71% camel wool, 21% wool, and 8% nylon. I have zero experience with this type of fabric and was wondering if anyone knows how durable it is, and how it stands up to wear. To me -- as someone who knows exactly 0 about camel hair -- given how soft it is, it really seems a lot more delicate than your standard wool blend.  I'm worried it will start to pill very easily/quickly and look like trash in a few months or years time.

My only issue is boobs, I wear GAP bras (not the best quality) but I wear their non-padded bras so my boobs look smaller.

They are not thick sweaters. Any advice? I know its so specific! I'm open to light padding, I just need them to be more perky!

118,femalefashionadvice,"OK so quick back story , my wife and I have discussed sundresses , pinup dresses etc a lot over the last while. I said to her that I would get her some things to try which  I thought looked good and she could return if they werent a good fit or she didnt like them. 

We are currently in a long distance relationship due to emigration paper hold-ups. So I like to spoil her, and I enjoy a slightly sexier look on her like a nice a line or skater style dress or the kind you can twirl in ( no idea if this makes sense as a dude my knowledge on the thousands of dress styles is a limited)

So long story short , I bought like 10 dresses on amazon and sent them to her. When they arrived the fit was hilariously bad, and some of them were the wrong colors and the only thing they all had in common was the quality was horrendous. I assume these were from Chinese sellers direct from china or something.

I then went looking on websites like ZARA  and every dress they have looks like a brown paper bag with arm holes. There is nothing feminine about it, not sure if they thought well lets make a real one size fits all potato sack catalogue or maybe im just old fashioned.

heres an example  or 2

I mean I would honestly deflate my wifes self esteem if she dressed like this because I dont think I would be able to stop laughing:

So my question is :   
1. what style am I looking for, what would you call it.  
2. where do you lovely ladies like to shop for these things , preferably somewhere with a  good returns policy (shes in LA area.

3. What would be a good price point to meet quality but not spend excessively for something she will only wear occasionally?

4. any other tips would be welcome! I honestly need to learn everything from shopping lingerie to the works, been quite lazy until now and weve been together for a long time. Want to up my game a bit.

194,femalefashionadvice,"I sat down to do my annual fall shoe care/cleaning/waterproofing this afternoon, and I thought I would share a quick reminder to care for your shoes and a couple tips for anyone looking to make their leather footwear last longer and look better.  The same way you moisturize your skin to keep it from getting dry and cracking, you need to moisturise your leather shoes to keep them in good shape.

I prefer leather shoes for all seasons, as I've found they last a lot longer than shoes with synthetic uppers and are more comfortable to wear all day whether sitting at a desk or walking around the city.

I took [a couple pictures](https://imgur.com/a/h6lBMpy) of the steps listed below... totally didn't take before photos as the idea for this post came to me mid-way through the process ;)  Note - these tips are for smooth leathers.  I don't own any suede boots or shoes and I have no idea what the required care for them is. 

OK - here we go:

* Grab a handful of old rags (cut up old tshirts or stained tea towels you don't use in the kitchen anymore work great!) and some paper towels.  

* Remove any shoe laces as they'll just get in the way.  Replace old worn-out shoe laces (measure the length of your old ones before going to the store!) as needed.

* Make sure you wash off any dirt or mud with some warm water first, and lightly dry off your shoes.

* Spot-test your shoes first!!  Pick a spot that isn't very visible, like the inside of your foot, and apply a small amount of your oil/ wax.  You might find that applying something to your shoes discolours or darkens them.  

* Generously apply your preferred treatment.  I like to use [Nikwax](https://www.amazon.ca/Nikwax-Waterproofing-Wax-for-Leather/dp/B001U0KVVC/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=nikwax&amp;qid=1569789941&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-9) for my harder-wearing heavy-duty boots (Blundstones) and [Mink Oil](https://www.amazon.ca/Moneysworth-Best-Mink-Oil-Tub-6-5-Ounces/dp/B007Z07PLA/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=mink+oil&amp;qid=1569789952&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-5) for my softer less hard-wearing shoes and boots.  I have found that the Nikwax darkens leather a smidge, and the Mink Oil doesn't affect the colour.  I've only used them on darker leather though... so YMMV on light-coloured leathers.

* Pay close attention to the seams on your shoes - especially those you're applying a waterproofing treatment to.  You'll want to really get the stuff into those seams to help them be more waterproof.

* Don't apply your treatment to the elastic bits on those Blundstones or chelsea boots!  It'll stain and you're not going to make a porous elastic waterproof by applying anything to it.

* Follow the instructions on the label... but generally you want to let your shoes sit with the oil/ wax for at least 5 minutes.

* Wipe off any excess with a paper towel, then buff clean with a rag/ towel.

* Replace shoe laces and let shoes sit overnight so everything can continue to soak in.

And you're done!  These are by no means professional tips and I am not a shoe care expert, even though I did work in the shoe department at Sears in high school ;)  Just a few things I picked up from my mom and have learned over the years of wearing and caring for leather footwear.",A friendly fall reminder to care for your leather shoes!

In this eCommerce era, it has become possible to find the best deals using a smartphone or a laptop, and get it shipped to your doorstep. It also became possible to score deals in stores, online and through apps.

There are 3 ways to shop smart and save money in 2019, before buying, while buying and after purchase.

1-How to save money before buying an item?

When I find a product I want or need, the first step is to decide whether to purchase it online or in store. Then what store or online platform offers the best quality to price ratio. I also look at some elements that I believe to be very important before making any purchase:

\-Shipping Policy: It's important to know if a price tag online comes with free shipping or if the customer is responsible for this cost.

\-Return Policy: It's also important to find out if a seller or a shopping platform offers free returns or not. With a free return policy in place, the seller will pay for the return shipping cost if the customer doesn't like the item received.

\-Location: Where is the item you are purchasing being shipped from? The items origin location will determine how long it should take for your item to arrive. However there are a lot of online sellers that use the drop shipping method. When the consumer purchases, the seller (who doesn't have the item on hand) then has the manufacturer or a 3rd party entity ship the item to the customer. These items are usually being shipped from overseas from countries like China, which will take a lot longer for the for the item to arrive. If you are OK waiting that long for shipping it makes no sense to go through a drop shipper, you could pay less by going directly to Alibabba or ALiexpress websites.

Following are some ways I use to score some good deals

Shop &amp; Save Money

\-Goodwill Outlet Store

Goodwill Outlet is a good example of a store that I never visited before 2018. Now I can go there and buy as many items as I want for very cheap, and if I'm lucky enough that day, I can find some brand name items, to keep or resell online. I can pay up to $1.49 for a pound of clothes (prices vary depending upon location). The Goodwill outlet in my opinion is not only for someone who resells online. I encourage you to visit the Goodwill outlet store in your area, it's an experience that you will enjoy if you like finding deals, and it's for a good cause. If you decide to go after reading this article or if you have been there, please share with us your experience in the comments area for everyone to learn from

\-eBay Auctions

eBay is another platform where you are most likely to score a deal. It's in my list of smart ways to shop online in 2019 for 3 reasons:  
1. Huge inventory with a possibility to make an offer, which gives you some control over the price to are willing to pay for an item. If the seller accepts you have a deal.  
2. HUGE number of auctions you can win for cheap if you know what you are doing. I usually score a great deal quickly by bidding on auctions that are ending soon with no bidders. I found out that winning auctions is a great way to save money and shop smart.  
3. Rare finds in all categories  
eBay has been around for a while and has a strong brand that offers a good buyer protection policy and has trust from around the world.The eBay platform is another smart way to shop, and also get rid of unwanted items around the house. I sell on eBay and keep a Top Rated seller status with a 100% customer feedback, just by keeping my prices low, accepting reasonable offers, and trying to give the best customer service possible. You can still get a good feedback even if the item isn't brand new, as long as you are honest and mention any scratches or blemishes in the description. You can find my store on eBay here. I will appreciate it if you check it out.

\-Poshmark

I love the poshmark app because It's easy to use, and it's a great way to find some good deals in the clothing category. As a posher, you can make offers on items you like and use the power of negotiation to your advantage to ask poshers to lower their prices. You can also follow the sellers you like and join parties based on brands or item categories you're interested in.The Poshmark App made it to my list of smart ways to shop in 2019 because it allows it's members to be buyers and sellers at the same time. It's a great way to clean up your closet and get rid of the clothes you don't use anymore.If you don't have a Poshmark account, you can receive a free $5 bonus when you sign up with my code SARADRETAIL.  
Disclaimer: If you use my code to sign up to poshmark for free, you will receive a $5 credit and I will receive a $5 credit after you make your first purchase. Please leave me a comment below to follow your closet, you can check out my closet here.

\-ThredUP:

ThredUP is another website that makes buying brand name preowned clothing and accessories affordable.Their customer service is great, their shipping is quick, and their prices are some of the best in the market. Every purchase I make in the thredUP website is a deal. Check it out here if you are looking for some high ticket items for a really good price. Some of the brands available on thredUP: GUCCI, BURBERRY, GIORGIO ARMANI, MAX MARA, J.CREW, THEORY, COACH, VINCE, MICHAEL KORS...

2-HOW TO SAVE MONEY WHILE BUYING AN ITEM?

There are a couple of different ways to save money while buying products. When you are buying online, depending upon your platform (ie. eBay, amazon, poshmark, craigslist, letgo, offerup, etc.) you may have the power of negotiating your price. Haggling over price is still used in many cultures all over the world, but ultimatley as a buyer we haggle to get the best price we can. Many platforms now have a way to haggle through ""Best offer"" or ""Make an Offer"" options. Of course the seller ultimately gets to decide to accept, counter or decline the offer. As long as you offer a reasonable price and don't low ball in most cases you can expect to pay a lower price than originally was being asked.  
Another way to save money online is through coupons, ecoupons, and promo codes. You may be thinking did I just read coupons, aren't those the things my mom cuts out of the Sunday paper. Well they aren't just for in store purchases any more. Everything is online now-a-days and that includes discount coupons. There are websites that offer online discounts and printable coupons for almost any item, any store and any retailer at the click of button. These discount codes can be entered at checkout to get anywhere from 10-70% off your total purchase. Plus on many platforms if you bundle (purchase more than 1 item from the same seller) your purchase you can save even more.  
Coupons have been used at grocery retailers for over a hundred years. With technology retailers are now able to offer their customers direct mail and email coupons, they can put coupons on their website and customers can even save them on their phone. There are coupons available for any item, any discount and any retailer. Its just a matter of finding the best coupon to use for your purchase.

Here you can check out Coupons.com for some good deals.

Shop Smart In 2019  
3-How to Save money after purchase?  
3-How to Save money after purchase?

You may be wondering what I mean by saving money after you have made a purchase. It doesn't make sense that you can save money after you have already purchased an item. Well in actuality I mean cash back rewards. Cash back rewards allow you to earn cash back on any item you have purchased, in turn allowing you to save off the purchase of that product.  
We are in the age of apps. We have become glued to our phones, never letting them out of our site, using them to not only make phone calls but browse the internet, purchase products, watch tv, read a book, etc. Apps have become a normal part of our phones anatomy. And there are some apps which allow you to make cash back by doing your normal everyday shopping. These apps include Ibotta, Shopkick, Receipt Hog, FetchRewards, etc. The basic premise of these apps is once you make a purchase you upload your receipt and based upon the items purchased and total spent, you will receive a point value. The points equal a dollar amount and once you reach a certain points total you get that dollar amount either through paypal or through gift cards, etc. Each app has its own unique additions such as getting points just to walk into a store, or scanning certain products. Its nice to know that you can get rewarded for doing normal everyday things such as shopping.  
These are the apps I use. If you sign up under me you will get starting bonus:  
Ibotta: gyrrrvo  
Shopkick: SAVE219356 - get 250 kicks for signing up  
Fetch Rewards: YF8AD - get 3000 points for signing up

[Do you truly feel that people of all ages should wear whatever they want and not worry about dressing 'age appropriate'?](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/da86x1/do_you_truly_feel_that_people_of_all_ages_should/)

I study depictions of Black women in entertainment media. And one of the things I noticed in terms of fashion and age is how older Black/Latina women are often shown wearing some of the clothes that some people on this sub would deem to be ""too immature."" When a commenter said they wouldn't wear bike shorts and a hoodie at their 30+ age, I found that interesting. In the very racially diverse area I just moved to, bike shorts and a hoodie are incredibly common on the older Black and Latina women. Low cut tops, shorter skirts and body fitting clothing were normal and not considered off limits for a 50 year old woman to be showing a lot of cleavage.  Essentially, what we deem to be age appropriate is heavily based on race and cultural background. 

For younger Black and Latina women, especially in areas where they are the minority, there is a different issue. Young girls are often told to cover up. And there have been numerous stories expressed about this alone when a young Black/latina body is inherently sexualized and a young White body is not. This is further catalyzed by body type and that Black/Latina women tend to be more curvy. I particularly dealt with this when my friend and I had matching outfits but only I got in trouble for being out of dress code. 
. 

**So this brings me to my question. Do you feel as if your racial background plays a large role in your fashion and the way you are perceived? Does that bother you and what do you do about it? Are there any fashion no-nos that you feel don't apply to your culture?**","Age, Culture and ""You Can't Wear That"": How do you think your race AND AGE impacts what is acceptable for you to wear?"

236,femalefashionadvice,"In this context you use your clothes to indicate that you belong to a particular group, whether it's social status, subculture, a culture, caste, work in a certain field or that you are LGBT+.

I am biracial (but look black) and I've been wanting to ask this question for a while, but I wasn't sure of how to word my thoughts. I think that because I am black first, woman second, and whatever else last, class signifiers tend to make the biggest difference for me since no one knows my personality at first glance.


I've talked about this before, but when I want good customer service in Sephora, Neiman Marcus or Saks, I wear one of my Chanel flap bags. I've noticed a big difference in whether or not I am acknowledged, treated and helped when I go in with my Chanel versus a Longchamp or LV crossbody bag. Suddenly SAs become interested in attending to me, offering me beverages and bringing out multiple sizes/colors. I come from a well to do background, but without the handbag to signal that my budget is bigger than what they assume based on stereotypes, I'm just ""another black shopper"" who isn't worth the time and the effort, or i'm a potential thief in their eyes. 
 
I also remember a black woman telling me that ""casual Fridays"" in the workplace aren't *for us.* I've been in finance for a couple of years now, and I have noticed that the handful of black men and women I work with are never casual, even on the days our company allows it. I feel like there's this unspoken rule that we still have to dress a notch above our coworkers to maintain the same level of respect among our coworkers, superiors and when we step outside of the building. Our clothes-particularly the *right* brand of clothes, signals that we have white color jobs that pay well. 

I think even how I style my hair shows that I ""fit in."" I normally wear braid outs or twist outs, which is both feminine and professional. It doesn't come across as ""political"" (I hate that afros are associated with politics) or offensive in the same way that afros or wash n gos are perceived. But when I was interviewing for jobs after college, I made sure to straighten my hair so that I sent the right message that ""I fit in"" and i'm ""professional."" I have to fight the stereotype of the ""loud black woman"" and avoid hairstyles or makeup that is perceived as ""tacky"" or ""low class.""

Or when I was in college, there were certain brands you wore that were class signifiers, like Lululemon leggings, Southern Tide shirts, chubbies (men), fraternity/sorority shirts.

So I guess I ask other black women or women of color, what social signals do your clothes send and what do people assume about you? Do you find yourself using fashion to work against stereotypes?","WoC, what social signals do your clothes/style send and do you find yourself using fashion as a way of fighting stereotypes?"

Announcement/Discussion threads will be posted on the preceding Tuesday with the prompts and links to the schedule. Feel free to discuss the prompts, share inspo and ideas, and suggest other prompts or tweaks to the schedule there! The regular un-themed WAYWT threads are posted on Wednesdays and Sundays.


# Themes for this week are **Bohemian** and **Pink**

**Bohemian**

Get in touch with your inner free-spirited hippie/pre-Raphaelite.


* This oldie but goodie [inspo album](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2c8pkl/inspiration_album_classic_bohemian_style/) covers a wide range of bohemian styles and gets a bit into the history as well.
* [Pre-raphaelite inspo](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/44mucf/preraphaelite_inspo/) by u/pursuingbear
* For a take that's more of a modern style, [Southwestern Grunge](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/7yi6yu/inspirationsouthwestern_realism_or_how_not_to_get/) Alas, this one is a pinterest-only post, but I liked how it shows how the long flowy layers and rich fabrics of more stereotypical boho style can mesh into a more wearable base style
* MFA was light on standalone boho inspo albums, but [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/65pxf9/modern_hippy_style/) on ""modern hippy style"" had a suggestion ""Johnny Depp has a pretty good modern Bohemian style. Just lots of scarves and wide brimmed hats. Maybe try looking at some modern folk/indie musicians, like Edward Sharpe, for inspiration. They all dress like hippies and bohemians.""
* MFA: [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/2yb6w0/decided_i_wanted_to_try_out_a_sort_of/) with some discussion of brands with a bohemian bent + a linked mori boy lite album


**Pink**

Pink! Millennial pink, Barbie pink, shocking pink, any kind of pink. Wear it head-to-toe or let it shine through one or two featured pieces.

* One of my all-time favorite albums: [Bitch, you owe me a tulle skirt](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/7qbvf4/bitch_you_owe_me_a_tulle_skirt_an_inspiration/) (also by pursuingbear)
* [I'm a Barbie Girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/cq9m0t/im_a_barbie_girl_inspo_album/) by u/Hellokatie930
* A quick search did not turn up any full inspo albums on MFA (just lots of suggestions to try light pink OCBDs), but rest assured anyone is welcome to submit an outfit for this prompt.


# Rules

* Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but [keep it constructive/factual, and try to focus on feedback that will help the person improve based on their goals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3jfxk8/how_to_give_and_receive_constructive_criticism_a/)
* Link directly to images on Imgur or anywhere else you care to host them as long as the URL ends in .jpg or .png. Please don't link to Instagram posts or blog posts for your photos. You're welcome to include a link to your IG in your post, but people should not need to go to your blog/feed to see your outfits. See [Rules on Blogger Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/rules) for the full description of FFA's rules.
* Don't downvote for disagreeing with someone's opinion.

You should have at least one clear photo showing your whole outfit in a neutral pose (if you want to share more in fun poses or share detail pics that's fine too, but we should be able to see the whole outfit).

It's always helpful to other users if you provide some context on what you wore the outfit for and what your goals were. If you want to write more about your outfit creation process or what inspired you, that's great! But 1-2 sentences is fine too. For example, ""It's raining here and I wore this to run errands. I was inspired by the color scheme and attitude of [this bird](https://i.imgur.com/bSSMVYh.gifv)""

258,femalefashionadvice,"Hello,
I own some really nice patterned suit pants (made of thin fabric) I really love because they look like pants worn in one of my favourite video games. 

I thrifted them and was really lucky to find them in my size, but while they're really tight around the hips (due to that, I pull them up to my waist, which doesn't look ultimately ideal but better than not wearing them), the pant legs are wider than needed and it looks a bit awkward.

Does anyone have advice on how to make them appear tighter around the calves without sewing them? I'm afraid of ruining them if I do that.

283,femalefashionadvice,"Hey guys!

So I‚Äôm not sure what to do anymore. I‚Äôm currently on my 4th pregnancy in 5 years and I‚Äôve always had the problem that my jeans slide down. I‚Äôm no runway model and in the past years I‚Äôve had some crazy weight gain and loss related to pregnancy, more or less healthy eating etc. I just started buying a wardrobe for my new body shape after 2 kids. Only to get unexpectedly pregnant again. 

I started at a size 12 gone up to 22. I‚Äôve spent a fortune on pants. And now I‚Äôm pregnant again. After loosing a bunch of weight. The last ‚Äúbest‚Äù fitting jeans I had were size 18 and I was holding off on buying new ones, then I found out I was pregnant and at 12 weeks I‚Äôm pretty much able to pull them down and up without touching the button, and can put both fists in between me and the pants.  

So I bought some size 16 maternity pants. But they‚Äôre still pulling down. I‚Äôve dug out some old maternity pants and they also pull down. 

Size 18 looked like I had enough room smuggle a squash in my crotch. Size 14 didn‚Äôt fit my thighs. And now after walking all day I‚Äôm annoyed to no end because o have to pull up my pants all the Time. It feels like I need a belt but those darn pants have no belt loops! 

What can I do? I don‚Äôt want to live in leggings only. I need pockets in my pants. I love legging a but I‚Äôve just gotten ‚Äúmyself‚Äù back in non maternity stuff and make up and having fun getting styled up. Even if I juts drop of my oldest to preschool. I don‚Äôt want to go back to baggy shirts and leggings. Did I still get the wrong size? Anything else I need to watch out for? I just want to look cute. And I‚Äôm no fan of skirts/dresses.

&gt; I‚Äôm reaching out to update you on issues we are experiencing in our fulfillment operation, which have resulted in delays for some of our customers and will lead to further interruptions in our service. These delays, which began on Sept. 13, are the result of unanticipated issues with a system upgrade to our fulfillment operation. Our technical team is working to fix these issues as quickly as possible. 

&gt; You rent for meaningful events in your life. We realize we have let you down, and we need to fix it. Here is what we are doing to make it right: 

&gt; If we have already missed your order as a result of these issues, in addition to issuing you a full refund, we will also be giving you $200 to use however you like in an effort to make up for this failure. While we know no amount of money can make this right, it is our responsibility to rebuild trust with you over time. 

&gt; Everyone experiencing a cancelled order related to this issue will be receiving a full refund and $200 to use however you like. We will follow up soon with specific instructions on how you will receive the $200. 

&gt; Finally, so that we can focus entirely on our current customers while we fix these issues, we will not be accepting any new subscribers or new event rental orders for delivery dates before Oct. 15. 

&gt; We understand how frustrating this is for you, and we want you to know how valuable you are to us. Thank you for your patience and for being a part of the RTR community.

343,femalefashionadvice,"Backstory: I have been wearing glasses for nearly 15 years, since I was an elementary school child. I have worn the heavy framed ""hipster"" glasses for most of that time. I have had contacts before for special occasions, but literally everyone who knows me is completely used to seeing me with glasses. Until recently, I have had a pretty poor relationship with my face, and have thought myself to be very ugly without my glasses to hide behind. That's changed recently for reasons unbeknownst to me. I like the way I look in the mirror when I'm doing my makeup without glasses more than I like my face with glasses. Because of this, I'm thinking about getting contacts.

The thing is, I'm super anxious about going to class, work, even around my family with contacts.  The idea of people not recognizing me and making comments about it is weirdly anxiety inducing to me.

They're not just obviously high-end photos with terrible English descriptions, shoddy web design, and bargain-basement prices any more. Thought it might be worth sharing here as well as a public service announcement and discussion. 

Basically, these are websites that scrape photos shared by DIY crafters and designers (without attribution, of course), and then claim to sell those items. 

*What I'm talking about here is different from websites peddling cheap knock-offs (see YesStyle, Wish, AliExpress, etc) that'll send you a janky looking imitation product, or occasionally something wearable.* Instead apparently many of these sites - which are popping up like weeds - don't ever ship you a damn thing. So even if you are willing to turn a blind eye to the ethics around ripping off the creative designs and professional photos of others, there's no guilty benefit to the frugal shopper for you here. Their whole business model is to steal your data and your money.

They are advertising heavily on Facebook.

So... if you see a too-good-to-be-true deal - especially an unrecognized brand that appeared as a social media advertisement out of nowhere based on ad targeting to your profile - be suspicious. 

**What can you do?!** You can try reverse image searching, looking up reviews (on Google; not native product reviews), and your spidey senses. Some sites have weird payment restrictions (no Visa, Mastercard; needs to be PayPal, or some other less secured mechanism). This should be a red flag. Sometimes you can see that the seller responsible for the transaction and the website are not identical or matching. Nothing against parent companies, but... another red flag. ""Contact us"" button might take you to Facebook messenger or other less official looking communication options. Definitely not what you'd expect for a corporation that sold the range of things that they claim.

I was just thinking about how many things keep me from wearing what I truly would like to. Some reasons I put on myself (such as trying to wear things that are flattering), others can't be helped (such as the fact I can't wear sweaters/coats because it is 90 degrees outside). My style would be maximalist Victorian with hints of Western, Aztec, Indian, and Folk.

394,femalefashionadvice,"TLDR; need tips for women's outfits that don't put pressure on my waist.

Hi all,

I'm not the most stylish person. I used to get by okay with jeans, shirts, etc. Unfortunately I've developed a condition which means any clothes that put even the smallest bit of pressure on my belly can make me feel unwell. (It's about the area between my hips and the bottom of my sternum.)

As a result I've been unbuttoning my jeans a bit and loosening my belts so they don't press into my body too much. That's fine as long as I wear long shirts and sweaters but it's not very helpful. So I've been thinking of alternative clothes / outfits I can wear. Unfortunately I have a distinct lack of style, so here's where you guys hopefully come into play. Can you give me some tips about what to wear?

An average, casual style is fine with me. I have a fairly average body shape, with the exception that my thighs stick out a bit.

A-line dresses would've been good, except that I'd need to wear tights or leggings with them half of the time, which also apply pressure. (And I'm not that much of a girly girl.)

## Themes for this week are Bohemian and Pink

As usual, linked inspo is not the all-encompassing definition of the prompt.

**Bohemian**

Get in touch with your inner free-spirited hippie/pre-Raphaelite.


* This oldie but goodie [inspo album](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2c8pkl/inspiration_album_classic_bohemian_style/) covers a wide range of bohemian styles and gets a bit into the history as well.
* [Pre-raphaelite inspo](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/44mucf/preraphaelite_inspo/) by u/pursuingbear
* For a take that's more of a modern style, [Southwestern Grunge](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/7yi6yu/inspirationsouthwestern_realism_or_how_not_to_get/) Alas, this one is a pinterest-only post, but I liked how it shows how the long flowy layers and rich fabrics of more stereotypical boho style can mesh into a more wearable base style
* MFA was light on standalone boho inspo albums, but [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/65pxf9/modern_hippy_style/) on ""modern hippy style"" had a suggestion ""Johnny Depp has a pretty good modern Bohemian style. Just lots of scarves and wide brimmed hats. Maybe try looking at some modern folk/indie musicians, like Edward Sharpe, for inspiration. They all dress like hippies and bohemians.""
* MFA: [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/2yb6w0/decided_i_wanted_to_try_out_a_sort_of/) with some discussion of brands with a bohemian bent + a linked mori boy lite album


**Pink**

Pink! Millennial pink, Barbie pink, shocking pink, any kind of pink. Wear it head-to-toe or let it shine through one or two featured pieces.

* One of my all-time favorite albums: [Bitch, you owe me a tulle skirt](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/7qbvf4/bitch_you_owe_me_a_tulle_skirt_an_inspiration/) (also by pursuingbear)
* [I'm a Barbie Girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/cq9m0t/im_a_barbie_girl_inspo_album/) by u/Hellokatie930
* A quick search did not turn up any full inspo albums on MFA (just lots of suggestions to try light pink OCBDs), but rest assured anyone is welcome to submit an outfit for this prompt.

But often don't include any more detail than visual inspiration. Or if there is an explanation, it's that they have a deal with the brand or it was on sale instead of why it works with the outfit.

\[If links are allowed I'll update this post!\] Some examples of what I'm looking for:

Audrey Coyne is another ""capsule YouTuber"" - she has a number of videos on styling, silhouettes, how to play with colour, how to take care of your clothes, etc.. 

DevanOnDeck is a male example, but he has great detail on why certain tops/bottoms work together, what to avoid, and gives a variety of examples with explanations on how to style different items. I've used him as reference for more men-inspired looks!

488,femalefashionadvice,"So recently I‚Äôve entered the world of online second hand shopping and online auctions with private sellers.

Mostly it‚Äôs been so worth it, I really love the thrill of feeling like I‚Äôm getting a great deal! I also like that some of the sites make it possible to search by material, brand, etc. 

However when I buy online, especially old clothes, I really like to know the measurements of the item I‚Äôm buying. For bottoms it‚Äôs the waist measurement and for tops it‚Äôs the distance between the armpits that I really want to know.  

This have lead me to discover my biggest pet peeve with this type of shopping: the lack of measurements or resistance to provide them. 

I‚Äôve now had several experiences where I‚Äôve been unsure about if an item would fit me. Sometimes a size like L/M/S has been provided, but I feel like this easily becomes meaningless in the context. (This is a whole discussion in and of itself, but I have clothes in a lot of different sizes depending on fit. With old clothes the sizes might not be accurate anymore since vanity sizing is a thing and evolves. Sizes vary between brands. Sometimes the sizes seem to be based on the sellers guesses stating ‚ÄúS-M‚Äù, and so on.) 

So I‚Äôve asked the seller and I‚Äôve been met with a surprising amount of ‚Äúresistance‚Äù. The main annoyance seem to be from sellers that already provided a general size and they seem to think the stated size should be enough. Even people who have provided a guesstimated size sometimes seem to think the question is irrelevant. 

Other reasons that I can imagine behind the annoyance: 

- people don‚Äôt have own a measurement tape 
- people suspect that any seller asking for measurements is some type of creep 
- people like to put in minimum effort while selling and just can‚Äôt be bothered 

Obviously the solution for me is just not to buy from these sellers, but I‚Äôd really like to get some perspectives from people who sell or buy a lot online. Any insights? Counterpoints? 

And what are other experiences and pet peeves people have from buying/selling clothes from other people online?

I have hyperhydrosis (aka I am constantly a sweaty bitch, mostly from the armpits, hands, and feet). I‚Äôm talking dripping sweat no matter the temperature or activity. I got asked the other day if I was still stuck in my emo phase because of my nearly monochromatic (read: black) wardrobe. While that‚Äôs fair, and not entirely incorrect, I told them it‚Äôs also because I‚Äôm always sweaty. And they said they have the same problem!

So that exchange made me want to talk about something I‚Äôve been holding off on talking about for a while. Dressing in the summer is easy, because everyone is sweaty to a degree. But sweating in cold temps is always a bit more noticeable.

Tips I‚Äôve learned:

- Pair tank tops with cardigans: the fabric of the cardigan, especially chunky ones, won‚Äôt show sweat stains and the tank top leaves your pits open to avoid the gross feeling of sweat soaked fabric pressing against you.

- Colors that almost never work for me: gray, white, beige, light pink, essentially all pastels. I can‚Äôt tell you how many white shirts I‚Äôve ruined.

- Colors that I‚Äôve found work: black, navy, maroon, magenta, patterns, bold dark colors essentially.

- Layer up! Wearing a spaghetti strap underneath is great for in-between moments like driving. I wait to put on my shirt until last minute to avoid sweating through it before I even get to where I‚Äôm going. I‚Äôve even driven in a separate tank top and waited to put on my shirt until I got to where I was going.

- Baggy tees are godsend: Fitted tees were the bane of my existence. They were so cute and I tried and failed to wear them many times. I would always sweat through them within a few hours. Baggy tees are much more forgiving. Sweat stains will still happen, but I can usually go a whole day before they‚Äôre noticeable. 

- Knit sweaters are rather forgiving: though they don‚Äôt absorb the moisture, so they can feel uncomfortable, they don‚Äôt show any sweat stains. I‚Äôve read that natural fabrics are best because they‚Äôre absorbent, but they almost always show how sweaty I truly am.

45,femalefashionadvice,"[Duro Olowo's Spring 2020 lineup](https://tomandlorenzo.com/2019/09/london-fashion-week-duro-olowu-spring-2020-collection-runway-lfw/)

About the designer: 

""Duro Olowu is a Nigerian-born, London-based fashion designer. He is best known for his innovative combinations of patterns and textiles that draw inspiration from his international background. His empire waist patchwork ""Duro"" dress was named ""dress of the year"" by both American and British Vogue in 2005.""

Another hit! This makes me think of so many things: cool-cats in Detroit, San Fran, and Atlanta in the 70s, Afro Punk outfits, pictures from Kenya and Nigeria in the 70s and 80s, Ossie Clark Swinging 60s, all mixed in a fresh, modern, and relevant way. 

I love the print mixing, stripes, and wild 60's and 70s kaleidoscope feeling of this collection. Just beautiful. The first coat-dress is hashtag goals. 

I can anticipate that people might feel those white patent winkle-picker shoes are hideous but I feel they are a nod to the effects of colonialism or on the positive side, globalism and multiculturalism: I recall seeing many pictures of different African and SE Asian cities in the 60s and 70s where traditional and local outfits were mixed with bare legs and European style formal men's shoes. I think they really make the look and are visually interesting while being a pointed comment. (Although I can't say for sure, that's just my impression!) 

From the Vogue Runway coverage: 

""Duro Olowu is well known for dressing women in the art world. The muses he looks to for inspiration reflect the discerning tastes of his stylish clientele. This season he drew on the work of Fran√ßoise Gilot, who is perhaps most famous for being Picasso‚Äôs romantic partner, though the 97-year-old French painter, art critic, and author is a creative force in her own right. Olowu came across a recently reissued collection of her travel sketches, and her colorful impressions of India, Senegal, and Italy from the late ‚Äô70s and early ‚Äô80s informed his new collection. [ poster's note: turns out I was right in my impressions!!] The soft pale blue and green tones of a belted cropped jacket and maxi skirt with gently ruffled hem were evocative of the faded yet glorious frescoes you find in Venice, a nice counterpoint to the rich, saturated palette that is Olowu‚Äôs signature. One particularly eye-catching coat in that series was spliced with panels of pale pink made from vintage interior fabric that Olowu came across on a trip to Lille, in northern France. It was upcycling done with a sophisticated hand.

The designer has been working a more graphic line into his repertoire of expressive prints lately too, and this season there was an array of micro-stripe motifs collaged to flattering effect along trench coats and bias-cut silk satin dresses. In addition to Gilot‚Äôs sketches, Olowu was also looking at the photography of Beth Lesser, especially her fantastic images of the Jamaican scene of the 1980s. The wide-leg suiting in primary colors and slouchy pajama sets had an attitude and sense of ease that was straight out of the dancehall.

Olowu is a master of mixed-media dressing, and for Spring there were several terrific examples to choose from, including a languid silk georgette frock tiered with several painterly floral layers. Beyond the familiar evening silhouettes, the new apron shape with double straps and pockets jutting out at the hip cut a striking figure. With its darkly romantic assemblage of brocades, the piece offered an arresting and modern portrait of a lady.""

62,femalefashionadvice,"Hi everyone! I want to start a discussion on fabric content in clothes we buy. I‚Äôm sure other people do this too but I tend to check the fabric content of clothing when trying to evaluate if said clothing is worth its price. When I was younger I tended to not really care, and just buy whatever was on sale and was deemed a ‚Äúgood deal‚Äù, but those never lasted more than a season. So I tried to start buying ‚Äúhigher quality‚Äù pieces that were more expensive, but if they were made out of polyester they‚Äôd still fall apart after a few washes. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt buy anything from Zara, despite it being marketed as a more ~high end fast fashion brand, because most of their clothes are made of polyester. I try not to buy fast fashion in general but Uniqlo still has my heart... I digress. 

Anyway I‚Äôm kind of obsessed with fabric content whenever I shop for a specific item. When I buy a wool coat I try to look for coats that are 90%+ wool. When I buy down jackets I try to make sure that they are real goose down feathers instead of a manmade substitute because those are never as warm. It‚Äôs interesting how items from previous decades all are deemed to have a higher quality and able to withstand years of wear, and it‚Äôs all because they were made with better materials and construction. Denim jeans were 100% cotton with no stretch, which meant they could withstand washing machines. Flowy tops were made of 100% silk. Etc. 

Finally, does anyone have any experience with the sustainable fabrics like Cupro? It‚Äôs made from cotton cellulose and feels like silk. I just heard about it recently and would love to try it one day",A discussion on fabrics

WOW. Do I love this! Firstly, similar to Tommy Hilfiger x Zendaya's runway, the variety in age, body type, race/ethnicity and gender presentation is such a breath of fresh air! Love it. 

These easy, pretty, sophisticated dresses with flat shoes (!!) shown worn in a way that everyday women who just happen to look amazing would wear them---with big tote bags, with arms full of plants from the farmer's market, with a coat draped over their arm, with easy hair and soft makeup. The only miss for me is the matching crochet jumpers---those feel too literal 70's kitch and over-designed to me. Everything else is amazing and I want all of it. 

From the description of the show: 

""Spring 2020 marks Creative Director Nicola Glass‚Äôs fifth collection for the brand. The season is inspired by a city safari ‚Äì where every turn, and every wardrobe choice, is an adventure. With timeless safari-inspired silhouettes reimagined in ultra-feminine fabrics, prints and colors, our girl is ready for her next big adventure. Nicola continues to focus on the brand codes she established in 2019 ‚Äì always keeping the brand‚Äôs core DNA in mind and staying true to the brand promise of Optimistic Femininity.

‚ÄúMy starting point for this season was imagining everything a woman would need for her next big adventure ‚Äì even if that adventure is right outside her door. I wanted to find the balance between functionality and style, using luxe fabrics but in relaxed silhouettes, and cross-body handbags in unique materials and whimisical shapes.‚Äù said Nicola Glass. ‚ÄúI love how no two women ever wear the same thing the same way. This season is an homage to that: To blossoming wherever you‚Äôre planted.‚Äù

The Spring 2020 show was held at Elizabeth Street Garden, a community sculpture garden in Nolita. In a conscious effort to help preserve the naturally beautiful garden, which has been in danger of being taken over by developers, 100% of the venue rental fee was given directly to the protection of the garden for the local community and general public to enjoy. Guests were seated in the open air on existing benches within the park, as well as caf√© tables and chairs that will be recycled for events around the world. Models walked down the park‚Äôs gravel pathway and wove throughout the sculptures and foliage to highlight the existing beauty of the space itself. As a special treat, the show notes were printed on seed paper, allowing guests to plant them following the show.""

Today while scrolling through the daily questions I saw someone asking about pinafores and whether they can be aged up or not. A few replies said that the clothes were inherently young and past a certain age not really appropriate.

Excuse my French but I think that's a bunch of crap. I honestly believe anyone can wear anything, regardless of body, gender or age. I also love pinafores. And maybe it's because I can't get my girls to wear pinafores to save their lives but I've kind of always seen them as adult wear (aren't they really just giant aprons?!). 

So here is my take on pinafores in the adult era for anyone else who isn't sure if they can rock one. You can and you should. I'm sorry I'm too lazy to make a gallery.

I love color and variety, and I've been living with a capsule system for about a year and a half now. It works for me and I absolutely LOVE it.

129,femalefashionadvice,"Hi! 

So I am a 21F and I love the look and feeling of leggings. I am plus size and wear roughly a 14-18 depending on the brand. I usually wear a L or XL for normal non number clothing. I work in retail and I have to wear black pants or leggings. I have been wearing for the past year the Macy's brand ""Alfani"" leggings and I love them! Unfortunately I have puppies, and they like to jump up and scratch at me when I get home. These cause rips on the pants and makes them unwearable because their nails cut through the fabric. I have 2 pairs of these leggings left and just ordered more. 

[Here are the leggings!](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/alfani-comfort-waist-pants-created-for-macys?ID=5271407&amp;cm_mmc=OpsEmail-_-240_sdd_order_confirmation-_-5271407-_-MB&amp;m_sc=em&amp;m_sb=OpsEmail&amp;m_tp=1Q&amp;m_cn=240_sdd_order_confirmation&amp;m_pi=MB&amp;m_l=5271407&amp;m_s=OES-EOD2401QMCOM092019&amp;cm_lm_mo64=c2FtdGhlZmFtb3VzQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==) 

I usually get a L or XL in these, but got 2 L's this time. I am 5'2 so they reach down to perfect ankle length, on the model in the picture they are a little high.

My question is, what are some brands that are similar in style to these? 

I like the fabric on them because it feels like normal clothing, I dont like when I mix the texture of normal clothes with the sport leggings (like nike or Lulu). I also like how they do not have any fleece on them at all, and are not super thin or extremely thick like some leggings can be. I am open to non stretchy type but would prefer it if it didnt have a button or zipper. 

TL;DR: I like these non sport leggings. What are other brands that make similar products that dont have the texture or thickness of sport leggings, or fleece on the inside.  I wear a size L or XL depending on the stretchiness.",Non- Sport style leggings recommendation?

I'm mostly wondering how I can age up an everyday wardrobe. I know how to do formal and business casual, but I'm at a loss in daily casual wear. I'm usually in skinny jeans that don't really fit me anymore, a band t-shirt and Converse, which I KNOW is doing me no favors.

218,femalefashionadvice,"I spent so. much. time. looking for an actually stylish work-appropriate backpack for a conservative office job, and I'd like to pass on that knowledge so that you don't have to. Particularly difficult is the fact that I live in a smaller place without access to a lot of big retailers, so I often had to compare things online.

Before anyone jumps in with ""just wear a normal backpack"": Yes, some people may just want to wear a backpack to work. Power to you! I 1) can't do that with any credibility and 2) would prefer to have a stylish all-in-one bag anyway.

My criteria:
- must fit laptop (small, just under 13""x10"")
- must be convertible (both handbag and backpack)
- must be durable and high quality/big enough to support the laptop + wallet + pen pouch
- ideally¬†$500¬†USD or less
- ideally leather (for look and durability)
- thinner than a normal backpack (so that it's easy to commute on transit)

I considered everything I could at department stores like Nordstrom/Bloomingdale's/Saks online, local stores, Internet, etc. Here's what I considered in my shortlist:

- Cuyana: convertible satchel
- Allsaints: Kita, Captain Lea, Darcy, Polly
- Leo et Violette: Le Petit Cartable
- Building Block: rucksack
- 3.1 Phillip Lim Pashli backpack

Even though they could work, I didn't consider styles that were explicitly normal-ish backpacks (Nordstrom Rhea, Kara, Mansur Gavriel, Madewell, Knomi etc.) because I wanted to be able to convert it if I had a meeting or event on short notice. I also did not consider the Senreve seriously because it seemed overpriced for the quality.¬†

I ultimately settled for the Allsaints Darcy. Here's what I concluded about each of the options:

Cuyana Convertible Satchel: this was a beautiful bag and I was really excited to see that it could be monogrammed. However, I did think it was a bit boxy. More importantly, there is no flat bottom or foot, so it cannot be put on the ground or a table. That was the biggest turn off for me. If they came out with a new style I'd certainly pay attention.

Leo et Violette: this is a gorgeous bag and I am still thinking about it. At the end of the day, however, it converts (in my view) to a *briefcase*, not a purse. I wanted something a bit more purse-like. I think this would work well for a guy.

Building Block Rucksack: this is a really beautiful sculptural bag. I almost did get this, but I couldn't find any reviews of the actual product because they're so new and independent. I was concerned the leather would be too thin and would get a lot of wear from my laptop.

3.1 Phillip Lim Pashli: I loved the look of this bag from the outset, and because the Pashli is going out of style, I found some colour options in my price range. However, it's a little smaller than my ultimate choice, and I was worried by how ubiquitous but also out-of-style this item is. I also preferred to go with something with less hardware, in case the bag got dinged up by commuting.

Allsaints Kita: it's a very popular bag for a good reason. I got to try out the small Kita in person, and I really liked it (quality leather, looks nice, seems durable) but found that the straps were already quite wide. I'm fairly short, but I do notice that the straps are quite far apart even for a not-short person. I can't imagine it would be comfortable to wear the large version as a backpack, so I ultimately ruled it out.

Allsaints Captain Lea: I preferred this bag to the Darcy because I liked the look of the grey and I preferred the pricepoint (quite a bit lower). However, I thought the size was ultimately too small to be comfortable for my laptop.

Allsaints Polly: I was not sure how the crocodile skin-look from Allsaints would last. The Polly, again, is smaller than the Darcy, so I chose the Darcy over it.

Hopefully, this thought process helps you pick your own! I will update this when I have tried my bag out for a while and have more thoughts on durability and/or functionality.","FOUND: Stylish, Work-Appropriate Convertible Backpack"

This is why I buy most things secondhand, but I wanted some pants that were actually flattering. Suggestions for my next pant purchase? 

On another note: does anyone else feel similar to me in that every time they spend money on clothing it tends to just disappoint you? I wanted to treat myself, but I just feel upset that it's easy $120 gone on a pair of pants that now look like very old pj pants on me. :-(","Super disappointed in my last two pairs of new pants purchases..

I can't seem to find good quality workout clothes that are actually cute and not super expensive. So far I've had luck buying Nike Outlet. And I've found a couple things at Sports Direct, although their stuff is quite simple and I haven't found anything that looks really nice (they have the basic branded stuff, but not the nicer, funkier collections).  I've seen Instagram brands online like Gymshark  but I'm doubtful about their quality, though I love the look of their clothes. I also like the look of some Victoria's Secret stuff but I find them a bit pricey, and when they have offers on, it's always for their bras+leggings, never their workout tops+leggings (I get my sports bras from Bravissimo). I like the look of fabletics but do not want to suscribe, and their non-member prices are not interesting enough for me to shop there.

I am 26, a graduate student and I've been struggling with that rut of ""I don't want to dress like a college student any more"" because I hate spending money on clothes compounded by the fact I'm an athlete so it is FAR too easy/comfortable for me to just wear sports kit...

So, I've just got back from Copenhagen (went for the half marathon) and did more shopping there than I've done in my life. I bought a cool fleece, a cardi I've been eyeing up for ages, a green knit jumper, 2 tshirts and a long sleeve top and a pair of black jeans.

These were all carefully considered choices for value for money / would they work with the clothes I already had. I have had some success in summer weather looking a bit smarter but I'm now looking to transition this into the colder months (I'm based just north of London, England)

312,femalefashionadvice,"Hello, I hope this is the right place to ask this question, as I'm looking for male advice but I had to go to the source for the inspiration of it, which is the modern witch look. I've found some old posts about this style for women, and I'm wondering how do I pull off a 'modern warlock' without coming across effeminate or over the top?

My initial ideas were to try to find out if style ideas transfer over, but I think that just kind of causes a David Blaine or british rockstar type look (Thinking Crowley from Good Omens?)

Motivational ideas for the style I'm trying to find a mirror for are Wednesday Adams, AHS Coven, Harry Potter, Good Omens (Anathema Device, although more casual.) I'm thinking common themes are dark but organic, natural/minimal with some accent of otherworldly curios (earrings, necklaces, rings, etc - predominantly female accents?) Without these accents though, it's kinda leaving me like Harry Potter, and ""magic nerd"" isn't what I'm trying to go for.

I'm wondering if for a guy, the style might just be more based on physical expression rather than outfit. Maybe try to nail down the organic yet darker colors... And.. maybe a nice pair of glasses? Less clean-cut look, add some stubble, let the hair get a bit shaggy rather than cleancut.. This is just sort of what I've come up with. 

Anyway, any women have experiences with this style, or a male who mimics it and how they pull it off? At the end of my train of thought, it seems like to accomplish the same ethereal vibe as a guy, you need to pull off a dark charismatic cult leader type vibe rather than wearing the look.",Looking for ideas or advice for a male variant of the modern witch aesthetic?

326,femalefashionadvice,"Hello all,

Might be a bit of a niche post, but I was talking with a co-worker last week about marriage and gender norms and the lack of representation for wedding fashion inspiration that was outside of the box.  

I went looking for people in suits for weddings (first as a guest) but then was sucked into the gorgeous world of womxn and non-binary people wearing suits to share their vows.  (And being in the wedding party.)  

I think it's important to highlight the different ways people can get married and how they can dress *to* get married.  And additionally, that you don't have to be gay to get married in a suit.  

Even though, for the most part, there is a strong message in societies that womxn must dress a certain way according to ceremony of wearing dresses or what's coded as feminine fashion.  (And that if you don't do that, well then you must be gay and/or gender diverse.  Even though there are plenty of gay and gender diverse people who do like getting married in dresses.)  It was a little hard to find heteronormative suit couples, but they are there.  

I will admit as a queer PoC from America the representation in the images skews heavily towards that, but there are styles and people from different countries around the world.  If you know of any others share in the comments below!

Lastly, I forgot to keep the edit tab open when making this Imgur album so the last half of the photos don't have credit from where I found them or who's in there.  Or numbered photos to make it easy to share which outfit you like.  Apologies on that.

**70's handwork you say?!?!** OH. MY. GOD. GIVE. IT. 

Anyhoo! 

Recently I was in Madewell doing a little retail therapy browsing and found [this](https://www.madewell.com/madewell-x-the-new-denim-project-patchwork-skirt-K6634.html) skirt as a return. I'd come across the items on Nordstrom Rack and really loved the [square kimono-cut jacket](https://www.madewell.com/madewell-x-the-new-denim-projectreg%3B-patchwork-cocoon-coat-K6698.html) but they were sold out. So coming across a return in my exact size of the skirt really was a find. 

Madewell was among the retailers offering steep additional discounts over Labor Day weekend, and I succumbed to an IG ad. I saw they still had Madewell x the New Denim Project items and I ordered [this jacket](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/product/2915202?), [this shirt](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/madewell-x-the-new-denim-project-stripe-mix-seamed-button-down-shirt/5250862), and [these pants after seeing them in the store as a return and then locating them online in my size](https://www.madewell.com/madewell-x-the-new-denim-projectreg%3B-patchwork-paperbag-pants-K6367.html). I won't lie: [the jumpsuit](https://www.madewell.com/madewell-x-the-new-denim-projectreg%3B-patchwork-jumpsuit-K6637.html) really tempted me when I saw it on Nordstrom but I felt by eyeballing it that it ran small and didn't want to risk it since they only had up to an ""L"". 

Quality: mid-high, especially for sale price with extra discount. The material is soft and feels worn in but not cheap or thin. Stitching straight, no chemical odor on clothing, hand and drape of fabric seems reasonable quality.

Sizing: runs small. These are structured items with no stretch. They have a slightly vintage feel and fit, meaning they are deliberately boxy but not slouchy or baggy. I sized up to an XXL in the waist length jacket and I'm glad I did. Same on the top. The pants I sized up, since they are high waisted and my experience has been I need a little extra room with fitted, no-stretch high waisted pants. 

Pricing: Fair, but stock is limited. I'd browse the Rack, ebay and Poshmark for these if you are interested. 

Style/look: **Adorable**. They've taken what could have been a really twee, Holly-Hobby style 70s ""country"" look and made it ""cool girl"" somehow. I'm still considering how to style the skirt and the waist length tie jacket, but cooler weather means I can layer the jacket over jeans, or pair the top with the skirt and tights and clogs for a 70's bonanza. There is a playful handmade or ""upcycled"" feeling that doesn't come off as rough, unfinished, rushed, or amateur. They are Barn Picnic Chic and I an HERE for it.

If you teach, do you ever wear jeans?  Does your department have expectations in terms of how you dress?  Do you see different standards of dress between men and women in your department?  Do you feel like your dress changes pre/post-tenure?  Tell me everything.",Calling all academics!
392,femalefashionadvice,"WAYWT (""What are you wearing today""), but with themes! Share your outfit photos to the thread that fit one or both themes.

The themes are always open to some creative interpretation, so feel free to add some thoughts around how you made the outfit ‚Äì what your inspiration was, maybe what else you tried but didn't work, what you love about it, what you're iffy on. The goal is to have some fun creating outfits in a slightly more focused way, not to win a contest on Who Can Be The Most Theme.

Announcement/Discussion threads will be posted on the preceding Tuesday with the prompts and links to the schedule. Feel free to discuss the prompts, share inspo and ideas, and suggest other prompts or tweaks to the schedule there! The regular un-themed WAYWT threads are posted on Wednesdays and Sundays.

# Themes for this week are **Dance** and **Monochrome**

**Dance**

Share an outfit inspired by a dance style (flamenco, swing, hip hop, ballet, traditional dance, etc)!


**Monochrome**

Wear an outfit of shades of one color. It doesn't have to be black or even a neutral ‚Äì monochrome is still monochrome for any color! This can be a good opportunity to focus on incorporating different textures or playing with silhouettes.

# Rules

* Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but [keep it constructive/factual, and try to focus on feedback that will help the person improve based on their goals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3jfxk8/how_to_give_and_receive_constructive_criticism_a/)
* Link directly to images on Imgur or anywhere else you care to host them as long as the URL ends in .jpg or .png. Please don't link to Instagram posts or blog posts for your photos. You're welcome to include a link to your IG in your post, but people should not need to go to your blog/feed to see your outfits. See [Rules on Blogger Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/rules) for the full description of FFA's rules.
* Don't downvote for disagreeing with someone's opinion.

You should have at least one clear photo showing your whole outfit in a neutral pose (if you want to share more in fun poses or share detail pics that's fine too, but we should be able to see the whole outfit).

It's always helpful to other users if you provide some context on what you wore the outfit for and what your goals were. If you want to write more about your outfit creation process or what inspired you, that's great! But 1-2 sentences is fine too. For example, ""It's raining here and I wore this to run errands. I was inspired by the color scheme and attitude of [this bird](https://i.imgur.com/bSSMVYh.gifv)""

393,femalefashionadvice,"I'm looking for a way to buy long lasting pieces of clothing, well built, quality fabric pieces, if possible not made in a third world country by abused and underpaid workforce. I don't care if it's vegan and that other stuff. My budget is limited atm so if I did buy pieces, it would go slow and careful. I am willing to hit outlets, seek second hand and such as well.

But which brands? Which brands am I least likely to regret? Which brands have reliable quality?

PS. If it's somehow helps... I prefer and look best in feminine outfits, simpler designs - sometimes interesting pieces thrown in, like stuff made for kibbe classics and kibbe gamines. Color palette - true autumn. I'm hourglass, 25, female.

PPS. I'm from Balkans in Europe. I regularly venture out to other parts of European Union (most often Germany) so I'm capable to look to other countries to find good clothes, as well as to order online if needed. Where I live I can't seem to find anything quality that will last me more than 3 months! All manufacturers that import here reduce quality of everything in order to profit selling on a market with lower prices. It's little more than a trash pile even in ""high end"" stores. We had some brilliant domestic clothing producers, but corruption and a rigged market that favors unsustainable import has driven most of them out of business.

Please recommend. Thank you!","Quality, feminine, minimalist wardrobe?"

447,femalefashionadvice,"I'm an average height, average weight hourglass in my late 20s. Most days, I feel pretty happy with the way I look and how I dress. I work in a relatively casual office environment, and I wear a lot of pixie pants and Uniqlo button-downs. My daily commute involves a decent amount of walking, and it's hot/humid AF where I live, so I don't like things that are uncomfortable or too clingy. I tend to be a minimalist, so this type of outfit works for me.

Or so I thought. The other day, I was looking through some drone footage (I work in video production) that showed my full body from a distance of 30 meters or so. I looked SO shapeless and so much wider than (I think) I am. I know that conventional thinking says hourglasses should look for styles that highlight the waist‚Äîwrap dresses, pencil skirts, form-fitting tops, etc. But...I don't really like those types of clothes (on me‚Äîon other women, I think they look great!). I've just always been into more androgynous styles.

So where do I go from here? Sacrifice my personal aesthetic to better flatter my shape? Or continue to feel comfortable and true to myself knowing that it makes me look like a blob? Is there some third option that I'm failing to consider? I've played around with tucking in shirts, but I have a pretty short torso and I feel like this just makes me look super squat.

458,femalefashionadvice,"Over the last couple of years I've sort of ""found my groove"" with buying clothing.  I've started investing in higher quality clothes, and when I buy a top, I make sure it goes with at least three of my bottoms, and when I buy a bottom, I make sure it goes with most of my tops. Dresses get to be wild cards.  Sort of my own kind of capsule, except that I utilize really bright colors often.

Making my wardrobe more like this has made things a lot easier and reduced decision fatigue - I can just grab any items from my closet and everything mostly goes together. 

However, my soul belongs to beautiful prints, and I can't help but cave into buying a print sometimes.  Someone posted a fashion video once where the person talked about how if you look at two shirts by the same company that are the same price, and one is solid and the other a print, the solid color one is almost invariably better quality - printed clothes take more effort to produce and so they have to find some other way to cut costs for it.  

This has been my experience as well.  I often cave to the polyester printed blouses at Nordstrom, or Modcloth, and they look so beautiful when I first wear them and fit my personality, and they're priced comparably to the higher quality pieces I buy from Eileen Fisher or Universal Standard.  But by the second or third wash, I see the difference between these prints and my neutral clothes - more pilling, aging, faded colors, etc.

So, for those who love vibrant and creative and intricate prints but also like higher quality, where do you shop?  For me personally, size inclusivity is a must (I'm plus sized) but all recommendations would be great here.","High quality, beautiful prints?"

462,femalefashionadvice,"I think this may get deleted, but I feel is really important for us women and female identifying people to hear.

I grew up in a  body-negative household and was chubby for most of my childhood. My mom with her own body issues would do research online to find styles of clothes meant to make you look skinnier in order to help me look better. I dropped a massive amount of weight unhealthily right before high school began but never felt skinny enough. Feeling at home in my body and my relationship to fashion was a life long journey.

After finding my style in college I felt more confident about my look and body, but moving into my young professional life has had me diving into fashion blogs and styling tips once again. I was looking at a pair of split waist pants that I liked when my first thought was ""they highlight my problem area.""

Suddenly, after years of work, I realized I'd gone back to evaluating my body.

You do not have problem areas. No part of your body is a problem. Not your 'muffin top' (normal stomach), your wide thighs, skinny shoulders, pointy elbows. These parts are parts of your normal body. If you're like me, mid-rise half waist pants are not going to flatter my tummy pouch and wide thighs in the way a high waist will. But does the fact that this style not flatter my body make that part of my body a problem?

Some styles will not hit your unique and beautiful body the right way to compliment it's beauty.

You don't have a problem area. You have a beautiful body that works tirelessly to let you experience life. Some clothing will bring out its beauty it, and others won't do it justice.",Hear me out: Your body does not have problem areas

I have leather sneakers and faux leather boots, I also have doc martens but even after having them for years I'm not convinced I've broken them in.

I wanna stay warm, look cute, and somewhat blend in (so I'm not a huge target for crime). I wanna attempt wearing dresses/skirts but I don't have a clue what kind and how. Help! (Am I overreacting? I was freezing when there was a cold front in Austin, TX in March)

467,femalefashionadvice,"After introducing loafers to my wardrobe, I felt like I had opened up a whole new world. I always hated flats since they tended to fall off my feet, and despite wearing sneakers daily, found them to be restrictive.

I am firmly of the opinion that loafers are the ultimate versatile shoe-- you can dress them down, wear them for work, formal occasions, parties, around the house, as everyday wear... and they elevate whatever outfit you happen to be wearing! And they're comfortable! And they come in a lot of varieties!

Here's an album of loafers (both in the context of outfits and alone) that will hopefully inspire you to try a pair in your everyday wear.

I'm looking for a reliable EU to US sizing chart for men, women and children that includes shirt, pants, and shoe sizes. Does anyone have access to one/ know how to do these conversions? I'm finding different answers on almost every chart I find!

Back Story:

Our city got a huge influx of recently arrived immigrants from Congo (by way of Angola and Brazil). I'm working with a local immigrant coalition to organize boxes of clothing donations we received. The immigrants will be filling out a clothing request form with sizing (they are most familiar with EU sizing), and we'll be filling the orders. We need to make sure we've got the right sizes, so our new residents can get the best fit.

479,femalefashionadvice,"Today I went to Plato's Closet to sell some of my clothes. I've sold many things in the past and they usually take 90% of my items. This time they ended up not taking anything (except one pair of printed gym leggings) because apparently all of my clothes were ""office wear"". I really had to hold in a laugh because I don't think any of my clothes scream ""corporate office wear"" at all. I had some floral dresses, shift dresses in prints and nautical stipes, and a couple striped chambray dresses. 

I guess even those clothes were too ""mature"" for the Plato's aesthetic. And as I looked around the store I saw racks and racks of Victoria's Secret PINK clothes, tees with massive logos, and crop tops. I guess my clothes and I really didn't below after all. In hindsight, I do recognize it was my fault for not realizing Plato's is mainly geared towards teens and young 20 somethings. I just didn't realize how ""young"" the vibe was. 

All in all I was actually pleasantly surprised and happy that my clothes do not look like they below to teens and young 20 year olds.  I take it as a compliment. And for the record - I'm 26 and my office wear follows classic silhouettes but is more edgy/modern with a dash of maximalism. I wear a lot of black but like to wear statement boots, prints, etc.

499,femalefashionadvice,"I'm starting a journey through the Curated Closet wardrobe improvement method, and I'm really struggling with everything. My weight has crept up over the last several years, and I'm now a size 18. I need some new stuff that fits me, but as I'm going through the two weeks of photographing my outfits I'm really hating everything, but I feel like what I'm really hating is my body right now. It's also why I have a closet full of shapeless crap - as I've grown, my closet has converted into a wasteland of sloppy clothes and half-assed attempts to ""jazz"" it up with something more interesting but ultimately not ""me."" 

From past experience, I know that I take best care of myself when I'm already in a confident, self-loving place, and I've just not been there for a few years. I'm working on getting back to caring about me, and several podcasts, some solo adventuring, and a focus on cultivating good things, has helped, and this Curated Closet project is a part of that. I need to feel good in my clothes as much as I need to feel good in my own skin. I work in a creative field meeting with wealthy clients who need to trust my taste and artistic sensibilities. Ill-fitting, baggy, cheap crap doesn't really sell it. 

So, I guess I'm looking for tips on dressing for my size in a way that won't have me spending thousands on clothes for the immediate needs while I'm also spending some time evaluating my wardrobe. I don't want fancy stuff - I don't work in a traditional office, and I rarely need a pantsuit or similar. Jeans and t-shirts work in my world, and a dressed up version of that might be a sporty dress with hiking sandals. Where do I find jeans in my size that aren't skin-tight skinnies? What are the best, most comfortable shapewear pieces I could invest in now to give me some more options within my existing closet? How can I accessorize to create leaner lines? Who are some good bloggers/instas/Pinterest accounts? 

I should say that while I do believe that everyone deserves respect, and I totally subscribe to a body-positive message, I also believe that it's to each their own, and my personal goals involve health, mobility, and vitality. I'm in my body and I know that it does not feel good physically right now, so please don't send me to any HAES blogs. I support your journey, but they are not for me. (Or do share, for others, they're just not what I'm looking for.) I love my body and want it to do the kinds of things that make me happy, and currently I have not cared for myself in a way that supports that.
